The paper proposes the use of a monetary authorities account to encompass both the domestic and foreign aspects of ruble currency circulation and a classification scheme for monetary accounts that permits the construction of analytically meaningful monetary aggregates. These issues are addressed within an analytical framework that transforms the Gosbank Accounting System into monetary statistics broadly consistent with the Funds methodology.

Not for Redistribution - iv - Summary The former Soviet financial system played a passive role in administer- ing the credit allocation decisions that were contained in the overall economic plan. To monitor and control monetary and credit flows, the Soviet authorities developed a detailed accounting system (the Gosbank Standard Plan of Accounts) that, with some modifications, can be adapted to the requirements of the Funds money and banking statistics (MBS) methodology. The major modification is the introduction of the residency criterion to distinguish domestic from foreign transactions. This paper presents a derivation table, or key, that allows one to construct monetary statistics from the Standard Plan of Accounts. Historical monetary aggregates compiled from Soviet data would not help determine the behavior of such aggregates during either the period of a command economy or the transition to a market economy. In the command economy, monetary aggregates played only a passive role, whereas in the transition to a market economy financial institutions have changed so rapidly that it is impossible to determine the underlying relationships of monetary aggregates to macroeconomic activity. When the MBS methodology is applied to the former Soviet republics, problems arise owing to the collapse of their financial institutions. Foremost among these problems are the treatment of ruble currency circu- lation and the classification of the claims on financial institutions in the former Soviet Union. Ruble currency circulation is a problem because the ruble is not the liability of a resident financial institution in any of the former republics except the Russian Federation. This problem is addressed through the intro- duction of a monetary authorities account that reflects both the foreign (nonresident) and domestic (resident) characteristics of the ruble in each of the former republics. Claims on financial institutions in the former Soviet republics should be separately identified in banks balance sheets. When claims have been made on defunct institutions, they could be considered either as de facto claims on the republican governments--which are the ultimate guarantors of their citizens deposits--or as charges against capital.

{"text": "Not for Redistribution I. Introduction This paper addresses the major issues concerning the compilation of money and banking statistics for the fifteen republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU). Its focus is immediate and practical, namely, how to construct analytically meaningful monetary statistics for these newly formed countries that were, until recently, part of a centrally planned economic system. The need for such statistics is compelling, in view of the efforts of these countries to introduce market-based economic institutions and policy structures that rely on indirect means to influence economic and financial developments. In addressing this need, the Fund staff have drawn upon their experience in dealing with the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe over the last decade, as well as the knowledge acquired in assessing the problems and prospects of the economy of the former Soviet Union. The approach adopted in this paper to the compilation of monetary statistics emphasizes the uniformity of treatment across all FSU republics, in part because of the common system of accounts found in each republic and in part because of the need to coordinate economic policies among these countries. In particular, for those countries that remain within the ruble area, uniformity of treatment of the monetary accounts will greatly facilitate the establishment and implementation of monetary policy rules for the ruble area as a whole. At the same time, an attempt has been made to allow for variation among the republics; indeed, the paper documents that some variations already have occurred among the republics and variations are likely to continue. Moreover, such variation is accommodated easily within the methodological framework developed herein. This paper presents an interim solution to the problem of compiling monetary statistics in the FSU republics, i.e., it adapts the existing system of accounts to the requirements of the Funds methodology for MBS. This approach will assist the authorities in these countries to formulate and implement stabilization programs that require close monitoring of economic and financial aggregates. In the longer run, the implementation of new accounting systems and reporting frameworks will further facilitate the compilation of monetary statistics. In adapting the existing accounting system to the requirements of the Funds MBS, it is important to understand the workings of the former Soviet financial system that gave meaning to the classifications contained in the accounting system. This knowledge is particularly important in addressing the issues posed by the liquidation of the FSU financial institutions (Gosbank USSR, Sberbank USSR, etc.) and its impact on the balance sheets of successor institutions in all of the former republics. Therefore, Section III of this paper discusses the workings of the FSU financial systen, including the reforms introduced in 1987-88 to increase competition. Section IV begins with a discussion of the major conceptual issues involved in adapting Soviet financial statistics to the Funds methodology and concludes with a proposed methodological framework for achieving this purpose.

The \"credit plans\" d e cas an\" Although the Soviet financial system was an integral part of the planning process, Soviet financial institutions did not play the role of financial intermediaries. Instead, the allocation of credit flows was determined by the central plan for physical goods and implemented through government administrative controls. In this context, the banking system functioned in the absence of credit and capital markets as a conduit through which the financial side of the real plan was implemented. The financial flows directed towards the enterprise sector were regulated by the so called credit plans\" of the central bank (Gosbank USSR). These credit plans were simply the counterparts of the quantitative production plans: the credit granted to each enterprise was based upon its production targets and long-term investment needs. Credit granted for short-term working capital was determined under the short-term credit plan, whereas long-term investments were funded under the long-term credit plan and largely financed from budgetary transfers. Enterprise profits were remitted to the budget; however, certain deviations from plan targets, such as short-falls of profits, were financed by the Gosbank, thus providing some indirect financing from the central bank to the budget. Therefore, the amount and types of credit extended to the enterprise sector were independent of the factors that normally influence credit decisions in a market economy, in particular the creditworthiness of borrowers and the risk and return preferences of savers. While the credit plans determined the amount and direction of credit in the banking system, another plan, called the currency emission or \"cash plan\" of the Gosbank, determined the supply of liquidity to the household sector. The enterprise sector was forbidden to hold cash except to make wage payments. Households received their money incomes in cash and made almost all purchases in cash; credit facilities available to the household sector were severely limited. The Savings Bank (Sberbank) provided the household sector with an alternative financial asset, namely, deposits; in addition, there were long-term government bonds. The Savings Bank redeposited these funds with the central bank, where they became available for use by the Government. Therefore, the thrust of financial policy was to 1/ Amore detailed discussion of the Soviet financial system before 1992 is contained in A Study of the Soviet Economy, Volumes 1 and 2.

{"text": "In the Soviet financial system prior to the reforms introduced in 1987-88, the Gosbank performed the functions of a central bank, except the management of international reserves, and most of the functions of a commercial bank. As the central bank, the Gosbank was responsible for the overall direction of liquidity and credit resources in the economy (cash and credit plans). The Gosbank also was banker to the government and lender to the enterprise sector. In this period the payments system was geared to the recovery of the cost of production of the enterprise sector, i.e., the recovery of all input and transfer payments, including wages but excluding taxes. Therefore, an enterprise would receive payment for the sale of goods from the bank (the local branch of Gosbank) upon documentary evidence that goods had been shipped. These documents would then be sent to the local Gosbank branch of the purchaser, which would then debit the purchasers account. However, owing to delays brought about by the transmission of documents through the mail, the payors account was often not debited until several months after the shipment of the goods. As a result, the payments system generated a substantial credit position in the banking system in favor of the enterprise sector, because debits lagged credits. In addition to the Gosbank, there were three specialized banks in operation in the period prior to the 1987-88 reforms: these were the Savings Bank (Sberbank), the Construction Bank (Stroibank), and the Bank for Foreign Trade (Vneshtorgbank). The primary function of the Savings Bank has been described above. In addition, the Savings Bank undertook some small- scale lending to the household sector. The Construction Bank was formed to provide long-term investment credits to enterprises, in order to gradually replace budgetary transfers. All foreign exchange operations were conducted on behalf of the state by the Bank for Foreign Trade, which also managed the international reserves and extended credit to enterprises responsible for foreign trade. 1/ In the period up to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, i.e., mid-to late 1991, the claims of a republics savings bank on the Gosbank could total almost 90 percent of assets. Since that time, however, the savings banks have channeled their resources to their respective national banks-- former Gosbank branches--as well as to other banks in the republics; in some cases the savings banks have begun lending to the enterprise sector.

{"text": "Not for Redistribution - 4 - b. The 1987-88 reforms and institutional changes The reforms of 1987-88 were intended to introduce a two-tiered banking system in which the commercial banking functions performed by Gosbank would be concentrated in the newly created specialized banks. Three new specialized banks were established--the Agricultural Bank (Agroprombank), the Industry and Construction Bank (Promstroibank), and the Social Investment Bank (Zhilsotsbank)--to channel credit to enterprises in their respective sectors. (The former Construction Bank was renamed the Industry and Construction Bank.) These banks, therefore, assumed all the commercial banking functions previously performed by Gosbank, including taking deposits from, and granting credits to, enterprises. Moreover, the specialized banks also acted as agents for the government; therefore, a full list of Union, Republican, and local government accounts was carried in the books of each specialized bank, as well as in the former Gosbank. The two existing banks--the Savings Bank and the Bank for Foreign Trade (renamed the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs) continued their former operations. In conjunction with these reforms, the 1988 Law on Cooperatives authorized the establishment of cooperative banks to service the needs of cooperative enterprises not served by the state-owned specialized banks. In addition, state enterprises were granted the right to establish their own banks. These commercial and cooperative banks (CCBs) differed significantly from the specialized banks. First, their activities were relatively unrestricted; they could grant both short- and long-term credits, accept deposits, and engage in foreign exchange operations.", "tokens": 243, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Second, their customers were not limited to a particular sector of the economy; these banks were free to service both households and enterprises across all sectors of the economy. Along with the transfer of commercial functions from the Gosbank to the specialized banks and the establishment of the new cooperative and commercial banks, the reforms brought about a major change in the operation of the payments clearing system. Under the revised system, the initiation of the payments clearing process began with the purchaser or payor rather than with the seller of the goods. When the purchaser of goods notified his bank to make payment to the seller, the bank immediately debited the purchaser's account. Inevitably, however, problems were experienced with this system as well: the crediting of the sellers account was usually considerably delayed, owing to administrative and other problems. As a result, the operation of the payments system slowed, and a very large debit float developed, i.e., a net liability of the banking system to the enterprise sector. 3. Reporting and accounting systems The Gosbank devised three separate accounting systems for financial institutions in the FSU. The Plan of Bookkeeping Accounts at Banks of the USSR and Commercial and Cooperative Banks,\" hereinafter referred to as the Gosbank standard accounting system, was devised first for the Gosbanks own International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution - 5 - operations. After the 1987-88 reforms, it was extended to cover the operations of the specialized banks that were created from the breakup of Gosbank and the operations of the newly created cooperative and commercial banks. The standard system was supplemented by two additional accounting systems for, respectively, the Savings Bank and the Foreign Trade Bank. Moreover, transformation keys were developed, which enabled the accounts of these Banks to be consolidated with those of the rest of the banking system at the Union level. In the first six months of 1992, the accounting conventions of the standard system were modified to some degree in the various republics; nevertheless, the basic structure and rationale of the accounting system has remained the same. The Gosbank system is a highly detailed accounting framework for reporting by banks that reflects the administrative regulation and control of the banking system prior to the introduction of market reforms. A summary of the major accounting codes and headings is presented in Table 4 (Appendix). Each account is designated by a three-digit code, with the first two digits indicating the broad class of accounts, e.g., accounts ranging from 010 through 019 are designated for banks capital, while accounts ranging from 070 through 079 are used for foreign currency transactions. The same account number was used for both asset and liability accounts, and not every type of account could be opened at every bank; some accounts were used only at Gosbank and at the specialized banks, whereas others applied only to the commercial banks. The standard system permits a separation of accounts along sectoral lines that is broadly consistent with the Funds MBS methodology. There is sufficient detail to separate the various levels of government from the enterprise and household sectors (see Table 4, Appendix). The system permits the identification of government accounts at the level of the former Union, republic, and local government, as well as extrabudgetary funds operating at the various levels of government, in particular price subsidy funds and pension funds. Enterprise accounts are differentiated by major branches of industry such as construction, energy, transportation, etc. The accounting system was used to monitor the financial side of the central plan, including the operations of the government sector. In this respect, the procedures for accounting for government transactions differed from those applied to the enterprise and household sectors. The major government accounts (090 and 110 for the former Union government and 100 and 120 for the republican governments) represented government revenues or deposits--a liability of the banking system to the government--and government expenditures--a claim of the banking system on the government. However, all government expenditure was financed by credit and not by a drawdown of deposits. At the end of each year the governments accounts throughout the banking system were cleared, and any net position was transferred to Gosbank; most recently, with the establishment of independent states these net government positions have been transferred to the accounts of the respective republican national banks. International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\nIn terms of the Funds MBS methodology, however, the standard accounting system has a number of weaknesses, foremost of which is the failure to distinguish accounts on the basis of the residency of the transactor; the system separately identifies only foreign currency accounts, some of which are with residents. 1/ Another weakness is the overlap between the government and enterprise sectors with respect to long-term deposit accounts--170s and 180s--used to fund capital investments. These accounts can reflect a combination of government and enterprise deposits set aside for long-term investment projects, and therefore the attribution of these accounts to one sector or the other may be problematic. The Gosbank maintained a system of regional branches that were linked to computer centers for purposes of aggregating the detailed accounts of individual banks on a monthly basis. Therefore, an aggregated balance sheet for the banks in each republic, excluding the Savings Bank and the Foreign Trade Bank, was compiled each month. The balance sheets of the Savings Bank and the Foreign Trade Bank were compiled using a different accounting system; in the case of the Savings Bank, however, aggregate balance sheets were produced quarterly, rather than monthly, owing to the extensive network of small branches operating in each republic and the lack of modern computer facilities. 4. Soviet monetary aggregates Soviet monetary and credit aggregates were designed to monitor performance under the central plan; consequently, their usefulness for monetary analysis in the period of transition to a market economy is limited. These aggregates included accounts drawn from the balance sheets of the banking system as well as off-balance sheet indicators of household wealth, such as government bond holdings and life insurance reserves. Moreover, certain long-term deposits of the enterprise sector were not included in the measures of money, because these funds were earmarked for investment projects. The monetary aggregates consisted of four definitions of money or liquidity: MO consisted of currency in circulation and some vault cash; Ml included MO plus the transferrable deposits of enterprises and the sight deposits of households with the Savings Bank; M2 included Ml plus the time deposits of households with the Savings Bank; and M3 included M2 plus life insurance reserves and other measures of household wealth such as holdings of government bonds. These distinctions, however, were somewhat artificial, in that they did not adequately reflect the liquidity of the various components; e.g., although enterprises maintained substantial deposits in their current accounts, the use of these deposits was restricted, and moreover enterprises could not legally hold cash balances. i/ Interbank positions by republic are an exception. International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution The amount of Currency in circulation was linked directly to the system of wage payments (see discussion of the cash plan above) and did not reflect liquidity preferences of households. Incomes of the household sector were paid mainly in cash that was recaptured by the banking system through the Savings Bank. Each branch of the former Gosbank kept an exact record of the currency it issued; however, the currency in circulation in each republic could not be derived from the records of the Gosbank branch because of net currency flows between the republics. Therefore, Gosbank (USSR) made separate estimates of currency circulation in each republic, based on accumulated flows of goods and income between republics and the amount of currency absorbed by the Savings Bank in each republic. Deposits in the Soviet financial system were more restricted in their use than those held with the banking system in a market economy. Household deposits were held mainly with the Savings Bank of the respective republic and were classified as sight or time deposits. Sight deposits could be used in a limited sense to make payments and, therefore, were classified as part of demand deposits and included in Ml. Time deposits were held for fixed periods and were included in M2. Enterprise deposits included in Ml were related to the working capital of the enterprise and were exclusive of long- term deposits set aside for investment purposes. These long-term deposits were netted against long-term credits for investment purposes and reflected in the credit aggregates. Deposits of local governments and pension funds were excluded from money supply; this exclusion would be in line with MBS methodology, if these levels of government did not have their own significant sources of revenue and, therefore, were dependent on the Union or republican budgets.", "tokens": 1460, "label": "heavy"}

Although these central banks were nominally independent, they did not perform various functions normally attributed to an independent central bank, e.g., they did not issue and manage their own currency, manage the republics foreign exchange reserves, or, except in the case of the CBR, oversee the operations of the payments clearing system.

The MFO system operated through account numbers 83* to 89% in the standard accounting system and used highly detailed cross-checking procedures that often resulted in substantial delays in payment. 1/ The MFO System also recorded all other inter-republican transactions between banks, including transactions associated with the issuance of currency by the former Gosbank (see Section IV.2 below). As of January 1, 1992, the CBR decided to centralize the payments clearing system for inter-republican transactions by the use of correspondent accounts with each of the central banks in the former republics. This action was designed to exert more control over inter- republican clearing operations. The arrangements for a centralized clearing system were finalized in the Minsk Agreement of early January 1992, which also established the Common Currency Arrangement (CCA), whereby members of the ruble zone could obtain rubles through correspondent accounts between their republican central banks and the CBR (see Section IV.3, p. 25 below).", "tokens": 170, "label": "medium"}

The Adaptatio viet Financi Statistics to Methodolo Although it is possible to adapt the Gosbank accounting system to the requirements of the Funds MBS methodology, questions arise concerning the meaning of such statistics during the period when major elements of the centrally planned economy were still in operation, i.e., for the period up to the end of 1991. Therefore, Part 1 of this section addresses issues that relate to the meaning and use of monetary aggregates derived from historical data. Part 2, on the other hand, is concerned with the compilation of monetary statistics for FSU republics beginning in 1992, when these countries started to dismantle the centrally planned economy and to introduce market reforms. Therefore, Part 2 deals with MBS issues that arise in the context of FSU economies, namely, ruble currency issue that is not on the balance sheets of the republican central banks and claims of republican financial institutions on FSU financial institutions. Part 3 presents the methodological framework that has been developed for adapting the Funds money and banking statistics to the FSU economies. 1/ A complete description of the MFO system can be found in the following aide-memoires on the Russian Federation produced by the Funds Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department: Reforms in Payments System, Central Bank Accounting, and Monetary Operations: Current Issues and Recommendations,\" June 1992, and \"Russian Federation: Reforms of Central Banking,\" April 1992.

{"text": "Not for Redistribution -9.- l. Int e ion of historic data Section III described the passive nature of monetary policy under the centrally planned economy and the use of the accounting system to monitor pian performance. To achieve their objectives, the central authorities imposed severe restrictions on the use of financial instruments by both the household and enterprise sectors. Cash also served a different purpose than in a market economy, because it did not represent purchasing power over goods, which in many cases were severely rationed. Households enjoyed only limited access to their deposits, and these were not transferable by check. The enterprise sector could not hold cash, except to pay salaries, and current account deposits (transferable by payment order) were limited to working balances. Longer term deposit accounts of enterprises were earmarked for investment, and access to these funds was restricted. These restrictions were intended to maximize the reflow of cash through the banking system to the government sector via Savings Bank loans to Gosbank. On the credit side, Gosbank segmented the types of credit extended to the enterprise sector, drawing a major distinction between short-term or working capital loans, which were closely geared to the production targets of the plan, and long-term loans for investment in plants and equipment. Moreover, the granting of credits bore little or no relationship to the credit- worthiness of the borrower and was not constrained by banks ability to marshal financial resources. In view of the highly detailed structure of the Gosbank accounting system (see Table 4, Appendix), it is possible to construct historical money and credit aggregates that approximate in coverage those employed in the Funds MBS methodology. However, the relationship of these aggregates to measures of macroeconomic activity is not helpful in determining the future behavior of such aggregates, given that both institutional structures and financial instruments have been undergoing substantial changes since the beginning of 1992. Thus, for example, household demand for cash, relative to bank deposits, is likely to change substantially when the moneyness\" of such deposits is increased through the introduction of transferable instruments such as checking accounts; moreover, the demand for different types of money balances will be affected by financial reforms aimed at establishing positive real rates of interest on bank deposits. Similarly, the demand for credit is likely to be affected by several factors not present in the previous system, in particular the charging of a real rate interest on bank loans. Therefore, time series data on money and credit aggregates for the period through 1991 would be of limited usefulness in monetary analysis and policy formulation.

The treatment of currency in the monetary accounts of FSU countries (1) Introduction\nThe treatment of ruble currency in the monetary accounts of FSU republics poses problems for the compilation of monetary statistics, because ruble currency in circulation does not appear on the balance sheet of the republican central banks. 1/ This situation reflects the fact that, until 1991, the now independent central banks in each of the FSU republics were branch offices of the former Union Gosbank, and, therefore, currency emission was recorded as a liability of Gosbank (USSR) and not as the liability of the individual branches. 2/ The Issue Department of the Gosbank (USSR) recorded increases in currency issue on account 020 (liability) and a corresponding increase in interbranch claims on the republic receiving the currency (e.g., account no. 834 for Belarus). The branch receiving the currency would record an increase in interbranch liabilities via account no. 830, with the Issue Department as Gosbank (USSR), and a corresponding increase in cash in vault (account no. 030) for the same amount. 3/ Thus, if the accounts of the Issue Department were consolidated with those of the branch, only two entries remained, namely, currency emitted (020) and cash in vault (030), because the interbranch credits and debits would cancel. These procedures for currency emission continued even after the former Gosbank branches in the republics became independent central banks. Moreover, currency issue remained the responsibility of the Issue Department of the Gosbank (USSR) until the end of May 1992; after that date the CBR 1/ The exception is the CBR which, as of June 1, 1992, assumed full liability for all rubles circulating throughout the FSU republics. As of that date, the balance sheet of the former Gosbank Issue Department was combined with that of the CBR. Based on Gosbank (USSR) records, it is estimated that total ruble circulation throughout all FSU republics at the end of 1991 was rub 275 billion, of which rub 99 billion was circulating outside the Russian Federation. However, these estimates are contested by authorities in several FSU countries.", "tokens": 362, "label": "medium"}

A republican central bank currently receiving rubles, therefore, accepts the incurrence of a foreign liability 2/ that is now recorded in the accounts of the Issue Department of the CBR. Therefore, a consolidated statement of the banking system for a republic would show only deposit money, given that rubles in circulation are not recorded as the liability of the respective republican central bank. This situation raises problems for monetary analysis and financial programming, because such a consolidated balance sheet would not give a complete picture of developments in the money and credit aggregates within the economy. Therefore, for analytical and policy purposes, estimates of currency in circulation are needed to augment the data compiled from the banking system. The accounting practices described above introduce an asymmetry between the accounts of central banks in other FSU republics compared with those of the CBR. The accounts of the CBR reflect a foreign liability, namely, rubles in circulation outside the Russian Federation, and a corresponding foreign asset, the inter-republican claims. The accounts of other FSU central banks, on the other hand, while initially showing both a foreign asset (cash in vault) and a corresponding inter-republican (foreign) liability, would eventually show only the foreign liability, because cash in vault is exchanged for domestic assets. Therefore, current accounting procedures suggest an implausible change in the net foreign asset position for the ruble area as a whole, arising from the process of currency emission from the CBR to the other republics. (2) The monetary authorities account\nIt is possible to account for the rubles in circulation in each of the FSU republics within the framework of the Funds MBS methodology through the introduction of the monetary authorities account.

In a less extreme case, some of the newly acquired ruble notes could be used to replace bank deposits, and the decline in net foreign assets would be offset in part by a decrease in deposit money (these two examples are illustrated in Table 1). 3/ In order to construct analytically useful monetary accounts that facilitate monetary programming and economic analysis, the Funds MBS methodology would reroute the ruble currency circulation in each republic onto the monetary authorities account as a domestic liability, with a counterpart foreign asset. 4/ Therefore, currency would be reflected in the monetary accounts, along with the fact that the ruble notes represent claims on nonresidents. These paired accounts would complement the set of paired accounts already recorded on the balance sheet of the republican central bank in connection with acquiring rubles, namely, a foreign liability (correspondent account with the CBR and, prior to the end of 1991, an interbank account with Gosbank (USSR)) and an offsetting domestic asset as the ruble notes are exchanged for domestic assets or a reduction in domestic liabilities.

Not for Redistribution accounts, recorded in the monetary authorities account, and is illustrated in Table 2. Table 3 shows the impact of an increase in ruble emission on the monetary authorities accounts of both the CBR and the respective republic. The proposed methodological treatment described above has advantages in addition to the fact that currency in circulation would now appear on the monetary survey. First, the proposed treatment establishes a symmetry between the monetary accounts of all the FSU republics, thereby rendering these accounts more useful in policy analysis for the ruble area as a whole. This symmetry turns on the fact that the net foreign asset position of the CBR and all of the FSU monetary authorities receiving ruble notes remains unchanged after all adjustments are made to take account of currency emission. Before the introduction of the second set of paired accounts on the monetary authorities account, the net foreign asset position of the central bank receiving rubles would have declined pari passu as the bank converted a foreign into a domestic asset. A second advantage in using a four-entry system in the monetary authorities account is that it provides an accounting mechanism for the eventual retrieval of the ruble notes in circulation and their replacement with a national currency. The ruble notes in circulation in the republics have the status of legal tender; if, and when, a republic decides to issue its own (domestic) currency, ruble notes will be accepted by the republican central bank in exchange for the new domestic currency. In terms of the monetary authorities account there would be a change in the composition of domestic liabilities associated with currency emission, i.e., exchange of domestic currency for rubles. In addition, the rubles acquired by the monetary authorities represent a foreign asset and would correspond to the foreign assets recorded on the balance sheet of the monetary authorities. These foreign assets, however, would not be exchangeable for other foreign assets but would be charged against the foreign liability originally incurred by the central bank in acquiring rubles (inter-republican liability to CBR). When the ruble notes were removed from circulation and destroyed or repatriated, the foreign liability of the monetary authorities would also be extinguished. 1/ (b) Problems of measurement. The treatment described above for ruble currency issue calls for recording the currency in circulation within each republic on the accounts of the monetary authorities.

Therefore, only estimates exist for ruble currency circulation in each republic. 2/\nOnce a starting point for the stock of.rubles circulating in each republic has been agreed--the most likely date for such a benchmark is December 31, 1991--the circulation in each republic can be estimated based on changes in the stock, owing to net emissions under. the CCA, and estimates of net currency transactions in the balance of payments. Under the proposed methodology, the initial stock of rubles in circulation in each republic would be ascribed to the monetary authorities account with the four entries discussed above. The first set of paired entries would show the stock of rubles in circulation as a domestic liability of the monetary authorities with a corresponding foreign asset, reflecting the fact that the rubles represent a claim on nonresidents. The second set of paired entries would show the rubles emitted as a foreign liability, recognizing the fact that the rubles were obtained from a (currently) nonresident monetary authority-- Gosbank Issue Department--and a corresponding domestic asset. Thus the treatment of the stock of rubles circulating in each republic owing to emission before the inception of the CCA would be symmetrical with the treatment of ruble emission under the CCA in the monetary authorities account. 3/ 1/ Before January 1, 1991, the Gosbank kept records of ruble emission through each branch and estimated all migration of currency, which was said to be small. (Most inter-republican transactions were financed through the MFO accounts, and as inter-republican travel was tightly regulated, net migration would be confined to border trade by individuals.) However, during the last half of 1991 and in 1992, it is likely that the volume of currency transactions across republican borders greatly expanded. 2/ It is important to note that inflationary developments since the beginning of 1992 have substantially reduced the proportion of rubles in circulation ascribed to the former Gosbank Issue Department and thus the importance of errors in the pre-1991 money stock estimates.

Claims of Republican Financial Institutions on former Union Financia stitutions (1) The Savings Bank As noted above, the major function of the Savings Banks in the FSU was to marshal the liquid resources of the household sector and channel them to the Gosbank (USSR). The Gosbank would lend these funds to the various specialized banks to support the overall objectives of the central plan. Deposits placed with Gosbank (USSR) would earn interest that constituted the major source of income for the savings banks in the republics. In conjunction with the breakdown of the Soviet financial system during 1991, Gosbank (USSR) ceased servicing the deposits of the savings banks, and moreover the status of savings banks claims on the Gosbank came into question. Concomitantly, the savings banks in each republic no longer channeled their funds into deposits with Gosbank (USSR). In the case of the Russian Federation the Savings Bank became active in the interbank market and began lending to the enterprise sector, while in many other republics the savings banks began to channel their funds to their respective national banks for onlending to the banking sector. Another issue that has compounded the problem of savings bank claims on the former Gosbank (USSR) was the indexation of household deposits. In mid- 1991, after the April price reforms, the Union government issued a decree that increased household deposits with the respective republican savings banks in order to compensate the household sector for the rise in the cost of living. These officially mandated increases in deposits were initially funded by increases in long-term Union debt to the Savings Bank. However, after the dissolution of the Union the status of these claims became similar to that of other claims by the republican savings banks on the former Gosbank (USSR). Initially, the great bulk of these augmented deposits was frozen until 1994; however, the Russian Federation freed these deposits in mid-1992, and some other FSU republics followed suit. As a result of these developments, a large proportion of the assets of the savings bank in each republic consists of claims on now defunct financial institutions (Gosbank, USSR) and claims arising from government- mandated increases in deposits. The question arises as to how to classify these claims, in order to consolidate the balance sheet of the savings banks with the rest of the banking system. One approach would be to treat these claims as de facto claims on government, because the republican governments are now responsible for the savings banks and, thus, the ultimate guarantors of their liabilities. 1/ It is also possible to treat these claims as 1/ At the time of this writing, the republican governments had not taken responsibility for the former Union debt owed to the savings banks and the liquidation committee of the former Union Savings Bank was continuing its work.

With the collapse of the FSU the status of the claims of republican branches of the VEB on headquarters in Moscow also came under doubt, and it does not appear likely that these claims could be satisfied in convertible currency in the near future. Therefore, for purposes of compiling monetary statistics these claims present problems similar to those discussed above for the savings banks. Moreover, these problems have been complicated by the fact that in most FSU republics a successor institution to the former VEB has been established and, in some cases, has taken over part of the balance sheet of the original VEB.

The consolidation of these balances with those of the central bank to form a monetary authorities account in each republic requires the use of offset balances in the accounts of the sectors that actually hold these instruments; in the case of the government this results in a reduction of central bank net claims on government as government deposits are increased by the amount of gold and foreign exchange holdings. b. The accounts of the commercial banks\n(1) Under the Soviet financial system most transactions between banks were recorded in the MFO or Interbranch Clearing system. The delays in the clearing system leading to the development of large floats-- accounting for the largest part of banks balance sheets--have been discussed above; these developments have important implications for the compilation of monetary statistics, in particular for the separation of domestic from foreign accounts and the identification of monetary and credit aggregates. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the establishment of fifteen independent countries, the need to identify transactions flows between each FSU republic has become paramount; without such information it would be impossible to determine the domestic and foreign positions of the banking system in any of the newly formed countries. In order to identify inter-republican flows, separate accounts for each new country have been established within the subset of account numbers allocated to the MFO system (830--860), and all FSU countries have established correspondent accounts with the CBR (no. 169 since July 1, 1992). However, it may prove impossible to accurately separate inter- from intra-republican transactions for the period up to the end of 1991, when the interbank clearing system was geared to monitoring the overall balance within the system and not inter-republican flows. 1/ : In addition, within each FSU country the distinctions between interbank float, on the one hand, and payments and clearing delays between the banking system and the rest of the economy, on the other, have important implications for the compilation of monetary statistics. Under the MFO system substantial delays occurred in finalizing transactions between banks and clearing centers, owing to the cumbersome verification system that led to frequent inaccuracies in the recording and verification of transactions. Such delays constituted a pure interbank float and, although large, under MBS methodology normally would be treated on a net basis in a consolidated statement of the banking system. However, to the extent that the delays represent delays in payments to, or receipts from, the rest of the economy-- 1/ It may not be possible to separate inter- from intra-republican flows for some republics for part of 1992, since not all inter-republican correspondent accounts were activated at the beginning of the year.

(2) Net vs. gross accounts: Certain enterprise accounts relating to long-term investments may be reported on a net, rather than a gross, basis in the books of the banks, i.e., some deposits are netted against loans, and therefore long-term credit to the economy is understated. 1/ In order to conduct an effective monetary policy, however, it is necessary to record all accounts on a gross basis, so that a more accurate judgment can be made about the role of the banking system in long-term financial intermediation. C. The accounts of the Savings Bank Owing to the large branch networks and their lack of modern communication and computer facilities, the savings banks report only a quarterly balance sheet to their respective republican central banks. Therefore, utilizing the savings banks current reporting arrangements would slow significantly the production of monetary statistics. Thus it is proposed that, until the savings banks detailed reporting can be made more current, the savings banks report a monthly aggregate balance sheet, sectorized as below, for all transactions since January 1, 1992. 2/ This balance sheet represents the minimum sectorization needed to consolidate the savings bank with the rest of the banking system. The sectorization required is as follows: ssets: Cash Reserve deposits with the central bank Other deposits with the central bank Deposits/loans to commercial banks Correspondent accounts Government securities (own account) Claims arising from the placement of funds with Gosbank Claims arising from the indexation of household deposits Short-term credit to households Long-term credit to households Basic fund (plant & equipment) Other assets (including claims on Gosbank) 1/ It should be noted that these differences can be substantial; e.g., in Russia, credit and broad money increased by about one third after grossing up was effected. , 2/ It should be noted that, where appropriate, such accounts should distinguish between positions with residents and with nonresidents.

A major purpose of the monetary survey is to identify the counterparts of the money supply, so that policymakers can relate the total amount of money or liquidity in an economy to domestic and foreign assets and, ultimately to the level of economic activity. Therefore, each entity that is included in the monetary survey must have a balanced set of accounts, so that the following identity can be derived for the system as a whole: Money = Net Foreign Assets (NFA) + Net Domestic Assets (NDA) In addition to a balanced set of accounts, MBS methodology requires that the accounts of each institution be sectorized so that the major components of money and credit aggregates can be derived; these components include, on the asset side, net credit to government and credit to the household and enterprise sectors and, on the liability side, currency, and demand and time deposits of the various sectors. Therefore, to derive a monetary survey for the FSU republics it is necessary to reclassify the existing accounting system into categories that are broadly consistent with those of MBS. This process and some of the classification issues that arise in deriving a monetary survey from Soviet monetary accounts are discussed below. e. Proposed unifo classification of accounts The classification scheme in Table 6 (in the appendix) presents a methodological framework that can be applied uniformly across all FSU International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution - 25 - republics. 1/ This approach will facilitate the coordination of monetary policies among the various republics by making transparent the interrelationships among the accounts of the various central banks. This transparency is particularly important for those FSU republics that remain within the ruble area because of the need for close coordination of policies, particularly of those concerning currency issue by the CBR. The classifications and sub-classifications in Table 6 use account numbers from the Gosbank Accounting System as applied in the Russian Federation. While most of the three-digit account numbers have the same meaning throughout all FSU countries, some variations have developed, and therefore it is not possible to provide a standardized key that holds exactly in each republic. 2/ On the assets side the table distinguishes the following aggregates: reserve accounts with the Central Bank and interbank accounts; foreign assets; gross claims on government (subdivided into former Union institutions, republican institutions, and local government, plus extrabudgetary funds operating at each level of government); claims on enterprises and households 3/; and unclassified assets. On the liability side the table distinguishes the following: capital accounts, currency issue (only for monetary authorities); government deposits; demand, time, and long-term deposits; foreign liabilities; inter- bank balances and central bank lending; and unclassified liabilities. The subaggregates under each of these main headings correspond to sub-aggregates in the Gosbank accounting system. The aggregates in Table 6 may be consolidated to form a monetary survey (see subsection (f) below). However, some issues remain to be resolved in order to increase the analytical usefulness of these data. The first issue concerns the fact that the underlying accoune ene system does not usually distinguish between re : accounts. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the foreign assets /liabilities of a republics banking system according to the Funds residency criterion. The accounts that comprise the set 070-079 are the main foreign currency denominated accounts, and as a practical matter it may be assumed that, on the liabilities side, 1/ The scheme is a reaggregation of the accounting entries presented in summary form in Table 4 (in the appendix). 2/ Some republics have begun using some account numbers for different accounts. As Fund economists gain more knowledge of banking operations in each republic, it may be necessary to adjust the classification scheme on a republic-by-republic basis to accommodate such differences. 3/ A question arises concerning the classification of consumer cooperatives, which may account for a significant part of total bank credit to the economy. In the classification scheme presented in Table 6 of the appendix, the cooperatives are part of the household sector. However, a case may be made in some republics for classifying the cooperatives as part of the enterprise sector. This issue may be settled on a republic-by- republic basis, as more information is gathered on the operations of the cooperatives. International Monetary Fund.", "tokens": 1731, "label": "heavy"}

The principal ruble- denominated accounts that concern claims on and liabilities to nonresidents are the inter-republican clearing accounts--usually 830 - 859--and correspondent accounts between republics, some of which have been classified as account no. 169. The present accounting system should be modified as soon as possible to distinguish between all resident and nonresident accounts. A second issue concerns the relationship between the monetary and fiscal accounts in each republic. Appendix Table 6 provides a subsectorization of the accounts of the general government sector into the following sub-aggregates: government securities (long-term credit); claims on the former Union government; claims on the Republican government; extrabudgetary loans to government; claims on government on account of price subsidies; claims on pension funds; and credit to local government. However, further work is required in each republic to identify those accounts relating to the consolidated central government, i.e., those accounts funded by the central government budget and/or accounts of agencies and extra-budgetary funds operating at the level of the central government. These distinctions are important in the Funds statistical methodologies, because the deposits of state and local governments--and agencies operating at these levels--are normally included in the measure of money supply, whereas central government deposits are not; the exception occurs when state and local governments do not have their own revenue sources and merely act as agents of the central government. 1/ f. Compilation of a monetary survey\nThe classification scheme in Appendix Table 6 provides the basic building blocks for the compilation of a consolidated statement of the banking system and a monetary survey. Using the aggregates shown in Table 6, it is possible to derive a monetary survey as shown in Table 7 in the appendix. This is only one of many possible presentations of the monetary survey; other presentations with more or less detail and presenting some accounts on a different basis (net or gross) are possible. 1/ The rationale for such treatment is that central government deposits do not necessarily bear any relation to the overall level of economic activity or government need for cash balances (transactions and precautionary demand for money, respectively), because the central government has recourse to the central bank. Local governments, on the other hand, do not normally have recourse to unlimited central bank financing, and therefore their deposits are treated similarly to those of other sectors of the economy. However, the monetary survey shown in Table 7 in the appendix treats local government deposits on a par with those of central government; this treatment is appropriate only when local government has no autonomy and receives all its revenue from the central government, i.e., when local government acts as an agent of the central government.

Not for Redistribution - 27 - The monetary survey shown in Table 7 can be applied uniformly across all FSU republics and, thereby, will allow analysts and policymakers to compare developments in monetary aggregates from one republic to the next. Such a presentation is particularly important for the FSU republics because of the need for close coordination of monetary and financial policies among republics, especially those that are members of the CCA and, thereby, continue to obtain rubles from the CBR. Moreover, this framework provides a consistent methodological treatment for the introduction of new currencies in the various republics and thus maintains comparability in the monetary aggregates, as republics seek greater independence in the design and implementation of their monetary policy.

We suggest 2s10s NZGB flatteners and 2s10s swap steepeners ahead of a dovish RBNZ. We maintain our 40y JGB outright longs, JPY 20s30s swap flattener, and long ly/y straddle positions. Currency & Foreign Exchange USD weakness should continue, particularly versus AUD, CAD, and JPY, but TGA balances may be a short-term headwind. Eurozone banks have underperformed this year, adding to EUR weakness. We suggest short EUR/JPY. We expect a dovish RBNZ and look to buy AUD/NZD on dips. We explore near-term JPY drivers and remain bullish. Inflation-Linked Bonds We think the recent decline in 5-year TIPS breakevens presents another attractive opportunity to go long. We also look at how the COVID-19 crisis has affected household inflation expectations to this point and consider the potential ramifications for actual inflation and JGB linkers. Short-Duration Strategy We discuss the source of the divergent paths of EURIBOR and LIBOR, namely worsening CP conditions in EUR and normalizing CP conditions in the US. We also investigate how T-bill issuance influences the two IBORs. We maintain 2y swap spread tighteners vs UO FRA/OIS wideners. Interest Rate Derivatives\nRate level and financial conditions continue to drive US rate vol. The market is pricing in a dramatic bull flattening or bear steepening in the swap curve. 3y5y vol trades quite rich to lySy.

{"text": "Even during normal times, investors debate the extent to which markets appropriately discount events Like these and sometimes even debate how and when markets are supposed to do the discounting. The pro-cyclical US fiscal stimulus delivered in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a perfect example. While it occurred in the context of a Fed tightening monetary policy, the Fed was raising rates gradually and predictably. Into the end of 2017, when the stimulus passed, and throughout the bulk of 2018, investors worried about the impact of higher government bond supply on Treasury yields. Throughout 2018, we thought market prices had already discounted the pro-cyclical fiscal deficit. And, as such, investors were better served by focusing on other factors that could move markets. In particular, we thought that, by the end of 2017, the rates market had priced in the expected increase in supply well before the US Treasury delivered any of the additional supply. Furthermore, we thought that markets priced in the expected economic impact of the tax cuts in early 2018. In retrospect, the environment that allowed us to analyze the situation accurately, we think pales in comparison to the complexity of the present. Over the past month-and- a-half, all over the world central banks have eased monetary policy and governments have eased fiscal policy simultaneously (see Policy Action Tracker).", "tokens": 224, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "For both central banks and governments, these programs broke new ground in spirit, size, and pace, among other modalities. How are investors meant to navigate the push and pull of fiscal stimulus vs. monetary stimulus in developed markets? Fiscal stimulus, all else equal, should raise expectations for growth and inflation, put upward pressure on interest rates (both real and nominal) and on breakeven inflation rates, and strengthen the value of the currency. Monetary stimulus, on the other hand, should put downward pressure on real rates, upward\npressure on breakeven inflation rates, and weaken the currency. When both monetary policy and fiscal policy are at play, in different sizes, in different regions, at the same time, there is complexity everywhere. Over the past month, this complexity has manifested itself in volatile, but surprisingly range-bound, rates and currency markets. Many charts now show a sideways consolidation of prices after an extremely volatile first half of March. Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA In rates markets, where the impact of fiscal policy and monetary policies is most clear cut, we've seen yields across G10 markets move in a sideways range over the past month (see Exhibit 1). The tilt of the consolidation toward lower yields reflects the direction of the initial impulse that began in February. Similarly, the value of the US dollar has moved in a sideways range over the past month. But, differently, the tilt of the consolidation toward a weaker US dollar has been against the impulsive move higher in the US dollar's value in March (see Exhibit 2). In both cases, the tilt of these consolidations reflects the power of central banks intervening in bond markets.

For the US dollar, we think the downward tilt reflects the view that the Fed will buy more bonds than other central banks, thereby increasing the supply of dollars by more than other central banks increase the supply of other currencies.", "tokens": 404, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "In Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place, we discuss how markets price each factor fiscal policy and monetary policy using the US and its markets as a guide. Is the TGA preventing a weaker USD? A key tenet of our USD weakness thesis has been the Fed's aggressive actions. By adding unprecedented amounts of USD Liquidity into the financial system - through asset purchases, repo operations, and various liquidity facilities - the supply of available USD liquidity would dwarf the demand for USD - sending the USD weaker over time. This is particularly true as USD demand has been driven as much by actual need as it was by lack of confidence (hoarding liquidity amid high uncertainty). Confidence in the Fed's actions, coupled with its actions themselves, should be sufficient to turn the tide. USD supply should exceed demand and not the other way around, first checking USD strength and eventually leading to its reversal. Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA One factor that has caught our eye, though, is the marked growth in the Treasury General Account (TGA), or Treasury's checking account at the Fed.", "tokens": 187, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "TGA has grown to an unprecedented size, rising $400bn in the past two weeks alone. TGA has been rising as the Treasury has increased its issuance rapidly, particularly of cash management bills, to raise funds in anticipation of payouts associated with the PPP loan program. This is important because, if the Fed is adding liquidity by buying assets, and the Treasury is removing liquidity by selling assets, then no liquidity might be added on net. In a QE purchase, the Fed buys a Treasury note or bond from the market in exchange for newly created bank reserves. Normally, when the Treasury issues debt, it does so to fund spending - so it takes cash from creditors, which is deposited in TGA, but then is quickly transferred out of the TGA to pay for its various programs. The TGA is simply an intermediate step.", "tokens": 143, "label": "light"}
{"text": "But what if the funds never leave the TGA or sit there for an inordinate amount of time? From the perspective of the Fed's balance sheet, this is in effect QE in reverse. Let's say a primary dealer executes two transactions. First, the dealer sells $10O0mm Treasuries to the Fed in exchange for newly created bank reserves. Its balance sheet is now more liquid. Second, the dealer uses those reserves to buy a $100mm cash management bill from Treasury. Now, the dollar liquidity is gone. Exhibit 3 shows how total reserves in the system have increased relative to the TGA YTD. Due to the Fed's liquidity provisions, bank reserves have grown by roughly $1.5tn. However, TGA has grown by $500bn. In effect, TGA growth has offset about 25% of the Fed's liquidity provisions, and most of that has occurred in the past two weeks. Perhaps most concerning is that the rate of change in reserves growth is likely to slow while TGA growth might continue at its current pace. Over the past several weeks, the Fed has sLowed the pace of daily UST purchases from $75bn/day to $30bn/day, and will slow again to $15bn/day from April 20-24. The Fed has decreased, and will likely continue to decrease, its repo operations as well.

Take up from the Fed's FX swap lines, for example, has been growing more slowly in the past couple of weeks, with net outstanding draws effectively unchanged month to date (see Exhibit 4). The CPFF, which became operational this week, has only seen about $1bn in purchases so far. Take-up at the Money Market Liquidity Facility and Primary Dealer Credit Facility has also been largely unchanged MTD holding steady around $80bn.", "tokens": 386, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Many of the other credit programs have not yet become operational. So in theory, the TGA could grow fast enough to even overtake total Fed balance sheet growth. This would mean a net decline in bank reserves because TGA and bank reserves are both Liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet - when TGA rises, excess reserves fall all else equal - so it would be a net drain, or a net reversal of QE. So for the USD, it seems the TGA so far has been a limiting factor on USD weakness, but it has not blunted the sell-off full stop. USD over the past two weeks has weakened against all other G10 currencies, most notably risk-sensitive ones like AUD, as well as most EMs (Exhibit 5). Going forward though we need to pay close attention to how the TGA evolves.", "tokens": 141, "label": "light"}
{"text": "The chief driver of the TGA will likely be how much Treasury issues in debt to top up its balances versus how much it pays out. For example, yesterday the Treasury paid out $151bn in rebates as part of the CARES Act, wherein individuals earning less than $75,000 per year would receive $1,200 ($2,400 for couples earning under $150,000) plus $500 per child. The CARES Act allocated $300bn for such rebates, so more may be coming.", "tokens": 76, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Looking ahead, we may see further drawdowns as Treasury begins paying out funds associated with PPP and SBA loans. The timing of when these funds will be drawn is harder to pin down as many of these will be sent out as physical checks (which are likely to be sent out this week), and the timing of the drawdown is a function of when the recipient receives and cashes the check. In short, we expect Treasury cash allocations to pick up toward the end of the month.

We anticipate further increases in issuance. Exhibit 6 shows historical and expected bill issuance based on what the Treasury Department has already announced. Based on these figures alone, we expect another $110bn in net issuance of Treasury bills through 23 April. Of course, we should consider this a floor rather than a target, because Treasury can announce additional issuance of regular bills as well as cash management bills. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty as to the precise day to day movements in the TGA.", "tokens": 277, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "While we anticipate greater issuance, it is not clear precisely on which days cash management bills will be offered and expectations can easily rise. At the same time, drawdowns may be driven more by the whims of the US Postal Service and American taxpayers and business owners than anything else.", "tokens": 50, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Still, what seems likely to us is that the overall trajectory for TGA balances is lower. Treasury has been raising cash for a reason - because it has bills to pay based on Legislation. So while there remains day-to-day uncertainty as to TGA's trajectory based on inflows (issuance and tax receipts) and outflows (payments), over time we anticipate a decline as the expected payments are made. Thus, for the USD, TGA growth might be a short-term headwind to USD weakness, but not a structural impediment. In fact, markets may be unprepared for what could very well be a large increase in excess liquidity. If TGA were to fall as quickly as it rose ($400bn in 10 business days), that would be the equivalent of the Fed purchasing an extra $40bn in assets per day - or roughly the size of its Treasury purchases every month during QE3. We thus maintain our USD positions - recommending selling USD against AUD, JPY, and as of this week, CAD as well (see CAD | Selling USD/CAD to 1.34). Our current stance on markets In global rates markets, we think that 1) demand from the Fed, 2) supply from Treasury, and 3) negative economic surprises will support the back end of the Treasury curve. As such, we continue to suggest investors stay long 30y. On the contrary, front-end UST yields are likely to face upward pressure in light of increased issuance, so we suggest 2s30s swap spread curve steepeners and 2y swap spread tighteners vs UO FRA/OIS wideners. We continue to like 5y TIPS breakevens.", "tokens": 261, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Lastly, we are watching an emerging relative value opportunity to being short 3y5y vs long ly5y. In the euro area, we suggest staying long 10y Ireland against 10y Belgium, as well staying long 10y Portugal vs 10y Spain. Currently, we remain neutral on BTPs given the uncertainty surrounding new figures for net issuance needs in the coming weeks and upcoming rating agency decisions. In Japan, we still see value in Llong-end JGBs with continued Bo} purchases and demand from lifers, whereas increased issuance in the front-end will likely put cheapening pressure on short-end JGB ASWs. We stay long 40y JGBs, in JPY 20s30s flatteners, long ly7y straddles, and long 5y JGB EUR/GBP ASW position. Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA In New Zealand, we think the RBNZ is preparing for additional easing at its May 13 meeting (or earlier) to counter the negative impacts of the lockdown. We believe these easing measures could include expansions to NZGB and LGFA purchases and an introduction of a corporate bond purchase package, among other measures. As such, we recommend entering into NZGB 2s10s flatteners and 2s10s swap steepeners. In foreign exchange markets, we see scope for the USD to trend weaker now while the Fed floods the market with dollar liquidity. One potential headwind to these liquidity injections has been the $400bn increase in the TGA over the last two weeks, which has offset some of the impact of the Fed's QE programs. We expect the TGA to decline over the coming weeks as payments for the various components of the CARES Act begin to outpace increased issuance. Our preferred USD shorts in the G10 are long AUD/USD, short USD/JPY, and short USD/CAD. In Europe, we suggest selling EUR/JPY. We view equity market performance as important for EUR and weakness in Eurozone bank equities has kept EUR as an underperformer. We remain bearish on USD/JPY given that the cheaper USD/JPY FX hedging costs may encourage Japanese lifers to increase their FX hedge exposure for their existing USD assets, and we see scope for USD/JPY to drop to 105. In the dollar bloc, we remain bullish on AUD/USD, as the Fed's easing contrasts with the RBA, which has reached its natural limit of easing. Given we think the RBNZ has room for further easing, we look to buying AUD/NZD on dips targeting 1.08. We think the BoC's relative lack of dovishness versus the Fed, continued stabilization in risk, and positioning should help push USD/CAD down toward 1.34. Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Interest Rate Strategy United States We see Treasury yields grappling with the push and pull of economic fundamentals and technical factors - (1) the direction of the economy (2) the focus of Fed's QE purchases and the (3) the focus of Treasury supply. While it seems Like a Lot of the negative economic news is in the price, the last week reminded us that scope for negative surprises remains. That, coupled with our views on Fed buying and Treasury issuance, favor being long 30-year Treasuries. We examine how Treasuries might fare as a hedge if risk-off conditions surface again. Recent data points suggest that 30-year Treasuries continue to be an hedge for risk-off conditions and a decline in risky assets, even though front-end Treasuries are now less effective as a hedge. We also examined STRIPS as an alternative to 30-year coupon bonds, and found that STRIPS offer some advantages over 30-year coupons for risk-off environments. Euro area In the euro area, the 10y BTP/10y Bund spread has widened noticeably in the last week as near and medium term uncertainties associated with debt-sustainability and possible rating agency actions have weighed on the market. We see a number of catalysts as having contributed to these concerns, some of which may have answers in the near term and others that will be more medium term in nature.", "tokens": 641, "label": "heavy"}

For some countries the projected issuance numbers are set to be the highest in a decade, yet as the ECB stand ready to do more to help the economy, we see room for further upside in our estimates. We also highlight the key takeaways from the 2020 Treasury funding requirement revisions to date. Japan In Japan, we discuss the possibility of additional JGB issuance with regards to a redrafting of the FY2020 supplementary budget. We see additional 8.6 trillion in fiscal resources to be required to cover the 100,000 universal handout. Using frontloaded refunding bond issuance to cover the entire amount seems appropriate from a \"smoothing\" perspective, but if calendar-based market issuance does end up being hiked, we expect the additional issuance to be mainly compensated by short-end sectors based on recent discussions of investor absorption capacity at the Meeting of JGB Market Special Participants. Morgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA We currently see a risk of underperformance at the short end (from TDBs through 2y JGBs) due to not only the aforementioned possibility of a further increase in issuance, but also increased uptake of various Bo) funding supply programs which provide banks extra 0% headroom in proportion to the lending amount.", "tokens": 266, "label": "medium"}

The net upshot is that banks will be in much less of a hurry to divert cash into TDBs and 2y JGBs with a view to \"avoiding\" negative interest rates. There will also be no incentive to buy bonds at yields below 0.1% for use as collateral. Moreover, there is even potential for short-end rates to rise in the repo market as banks look to take full advantage of their zero-interest allowances. In any case, we see a non-negligible risk of both GC-LIBOR spreads and short-end JGB ASWs cheapening from current levels.

New Zealand We think the RBNZ is preparing for additional easing at its May 13 meeting or earlier if financial conditions tighten unexpectedly. The RBNZ has already eased significantly, but it may be insufficient to counteract the negative economic impact of the Lockdown. A \"kitchen sink\" easing approach of various measures looks most likely, given Governor Orr's emphasis that overreliance on one tool is imprudent. We evaluate the RBNZ's various unconventional monetary policy options. Some have already been pursued (forward guidance, TLF, NZGB purchases) and can be expanded further but only to a limited degree. We think purchasing private assets and receiving interest rate swaps are the most effective next steps froma risk/reward perspective compared to buying foreign assets or a negative OCR. Our base case for easing is: a strengthening of forward guidance with economic thresholds; a reduction in pricing in the TLF to the OCR; an additional NZ$20bn in NZGB purchases and NZ$2bn in LGFA purchases; a new NZ$5bn corporate bond purchase package; and intervening in interest rate swaps out to three years. We recommend entering into NZGB 2s10s flatteners and 2s10s swap steepeners ahead of the RBNZ's additional easing.

On economic fundamentals, our economics team expects a slow and shallow recovery after a deep recession, leaving scope for negative economic surprises over the coming weeks. Given the possibility of disappointing economic data ahead, it is important to consider the efficacy of Treasuries as a risk-off hedge. 10 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Treasuries continue to be a good risk-off hedge\nAs Treasury yields have declined toward their all-time lows, a natural question has been the role of Treasuries as a hedging instrument for other risky assets. Additionally, with significant Treasury supply in the pipeline, the correlation between Treasury yields and equities can sometimes deviate from convention. For example, there have been days over the last month when risky asset weakness has coincided with a rise in yields, bringing the question of Treasuries as a hedging instrument into sharper focus. We would not read much into such moves, simply because many of these days, such as March 18 or March 24, were dominated by news on the fiscal stimulus, and consequently higher Treasury supply. Overall, we see Treasuries continuing to be a good hedge for risk-off conditions.

{"text": "We can see that the correlation has been on the higher side for much of 2020, and hasn't declined much over recent weeks. It is notable that correlation between 2-year yields and equities has declined over recent weeks, as front-end yields have become closely tied around the zero lower bound. STRIPS : An understated hedge for risk-off environments? While we favor owning 30-year Treasury bonds, given the mix of favorable fundamentals and technicals that we have discussed above, we think investors who own Treasuries in their portfolio as a risk-off hedge should consider STRIPS as an alternative. Below we compare the pros and cons of holding plain vanilla 30-year coupon Treasury bonds vs. 30y coupon Treasury STRIPS. We find that STRIPS can be an attractive alternative to owning long bonds as a risk-off hedge, given its higher duration, our view for a yield curve flattening, and comparable liquidity in STRIPS vs. coupon bonds.

A longer duration and a liquidity premium give STRIPS a higher risk premium than that of Treasury bonds. Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA The longer duration of a 30-year Treasury STRIPS (29.6 years) vs. a 30-year coupon bond (current duration 23.1) offers investors enhanced price appreciation for similar decline in yields - a valuable property for investors. Exhibit 9 shows the yield differential (Spread) between the 30-year Treasury STRIPS and 30-year Treasury bond. The yield level of STRIPS is highly correlated to yields on coupon bonds, and therefore STRIPS carry the same risk-off protection as long bonds, with a higher duration. Favorable yield curve dynamics: As the yield curve flattens, one may expect that the spread between the STRIPS and coupon bond yields should tighten because investors will Look for additional yield in STRIPS. Such spread tightening translates into the STRIPS outperforming the coupon Treasury, offering STRIPS holders additional gains. This relationship is evident in Exhibit 10 and Exhibit 11 where we plot the spread against the 10s30s and the 5s30s treasury yield spreads. In our view, a risk-off move in the market with lower yields is likely to be accompanied by curve flattening given that (1) the back-end yields have more room to decline and (2) we would also expect the Fed to ease financial conditions by biasing its Treasury purchases in the back end.", "tokens": 295, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Such a flattening would further support STRIPS over coupon bonds. Is STRIPS liquidity an issue during risk-off periods? While higher duration, and favorable yield curve dynamics work in favor of owning STRIPS as a risk-off hedge, intuition would suggest that STRIPS may not be as liquid as coupon bonds during market stress. We evaluated this hypothesis and did not find strong evidence that STRIPS have a liquidity issue vs. coupon bonds. To examine this, we first regressed the STRIPS-coupon bond yield spread vs. the 5s30s yield curve, and calculated the residual, thereby removing the effect of curve moves, We then plotted and compared the spread's residual vs. the 10s30s curve to the MSFCI Index and noted that, as Exhibit 12 depicts, the spread vs. curve residual is uncorrelated to financial conditions, suggesting STRIPS do not face liquidity challenges in periods of stress.

We think that the Fed will slowly taper the pace of purchases to $50bn per week for the week of the April FOMC meeting (on April 28-29), and announce a monthly program thereafter focused on the back end of the Treasury curve.

Exhibit 14 highlights how the Fed has structured its QE purchases so far, and how that compares to QE2 and the maturity extension program. We note three things: e The weighted avg. DVO1 of the Feds purchases has been roughly stable over the last few weeks and has gone up or down in small amounts. e The weighted average DVO1 of the Fed's purchases is below the weighted average DVO1 of Treasuries outstanding, suggesting that Fed buying has been front-end focused. e The weighted average DVO1 of the Fed's purchases is far below the weighted average DVO1 of the Feds buying in Operation Twist.

As coupon supply picks up over the coming months and the pace of Fed buying reduces, we expect to see some normalization in Treasury supply, with positive net coupon supply in only a handful of months in 2020, mostly in 4Q20. The Treasury refunding questionnaire released on Friday didn't offer any clues on how the Treasury plans to address its overall funding needs. However, given the deluge in t- bill supply in the past few weeks, as well as the $2bn increase in 3-year notes vs $1bn increase in 10s and 30s, suggests that the Treasury will focus issuance on the front end as we expect.

{"text": "Short answer excluding bills, yes.", "tokens": 5, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Including bills, its a much closer call. We expected Italy to start 2020 needing to issue 243bn gross ex bills and 390bn including full bill rollover. Our forecasts always assume 100% of net issuance into BTPs and assumed a net financing need in 2020 of about 40bn. However, we now forecast total gross ex bills to rise to 334bn given an expectation for an additional 90bn of net issuance relative to the start of the year (Exhibit 27). At this level of issuance, we forecast full-year Italian net issuance ex bills post redemptions and all sources of ECB buying at -45bn before accounting for a 250bn upsize to the PEPP that our economists are looking for in the fall. Importantly, we assume the PSPP at 75% of the total combined programs, rather than close to 80%, while also assuming 10% of the PSPP is purchased in supras. Our assumptions see strict adherence to the capital key, but the ECB shown already in March they could deviate significantly. YTD Italy has completed more than 83bn of issuance ex bills and 145bn of issuance including bills as of mid-April. For the remainder of the year, Italy has 140bn of debt ex bills maturing across a number of instruments and 236bn including bills. At our forecast levels, this means Italy has about 250bn of remaining issuance in 2020 ex bills and close to 350bn including bills. This is before any ECB buying and remaining redemptions. As noted previously, when factoring in full redemptions and ECB buying without aggressive capital key deviation for the remainder of the year, ex-bills issuance stays negative, while issuance with bills is net positive in 2020.

Our read on S&P and Moody's language, from recent reviews, has been consistent with the view that the shock is certainly damaging, but any forecasts are highly uncertain at this point, meaning countries should be assessed based on their fiscal performance prior the start of the crisis and relative to how debt-servicing and funding costs are evolving.

On April 3, Fitch changed Cyprus's positive outlook to stable while affirming the rating at BBB-. And also on April 3, Fitch changed Belgium's outlook to negative from Stable.

In our view, had the Covid-19 crisis not hit, we'd be talking about the potential for outlook and ratings upgrades currently, instead of the opposite. But the reality is Covid-19 has hit, meaning that Italy is very likely going to experience a sharp rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio, particularly should the economy remain in lockdown for a prolonged period of time and tourism and taxation receipts not recover. And for some market participants and rating agencies, that higher level of outstanding debt may be perceived as needing larger premia. However, in our view, the ECB are well aware of this and its why they have stayed committed to ensuring the smooth transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. They know, as do the rating agencies, that Italy is likely to experience next to no increase in the cost of servicing its outstanding debt, even with an additional 200bn of issuance between now and the end of 2021, if all-in funding costs remain at current or even marginally higher levels during the next couple of years. So what's the funding cost number? We see it at 1.75%, assuming 200bn of additional net issuance between now and 2021. As long as Italys all-in funding cost for the refinancing of all maturing debt and the issuance of all new debt (which we assume exclusively in BTPs and not bills) remains around 1.75%, Italy will experience next to no increase in debt servicing costs. 19 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA That's how powerful the refinancing wave will be as maturing higher coupons are refinanced, even with the presence of substantially more issuance.", "tokens": 507, "label": "heavy"}

And even if yields rose to 1%, France would still have debt servicing cost savings close to 750mn in 2020, despite a debt-to-GDP ratio that will likely rise potentially anywhere from 10-20% to well north of 100%, should the IMF forecasts prove correct. 20 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA This is the challenge with getting too bearish over the medium term on the EGB market if the ECB can keep yield levels close to where they currently are or for many countries even 50-10 0bp higher.

We use our economists forecasts for fiscal deficit, GDP growth and inflation by country to determine the respective levels of government funding requirements. We also extrapolate the statistics from some of the National Treasuries' revised remits. Bond issuance size will also depend on the choice of financing instruments and the use of other facilities like ESM Loans (see How much supply could the ESM absorb?). Eurosystem purchases: Our estimates of purchases under both PSPP and PEPP assume proportionate buying relative to our expectation of the available universe under the 33% issuer limit and strict adherence to the capital key. In such circumstances, a significant part of the eligible universe in countries like Germany would be in regional/local/approved agency debt, reflected in a lower share of Federal government bonds. However, given the flexibility of the PEPP terms outlined in the Decision (EU) 2020/440 of the European Central Bank this week, these assumptions may not accurately reflect the Eurosystem's buying pattern. At the same time, as we first discussed in The PEPP Playbook, even if countries choose to increase their remaining issuance for the year by 50%, most of it is set to be absorbed by the Eurosystem. We also include our estimates of reinvestment flows into the aggregate Eurosystem purchases number. 24\nMorgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA Funding progress to date: Our estimates suggest that ten largest Eurozone economies (ex-Greece), have issued roughly a third of projected numbers to date (Exhibit 28).

{"text": "Koichi Sugisaki Koichi.Sugisaki@morganstanleymufg.com +81 3 6836-8428 Will JGB issuance be hiked further? JGBs have failed to match the UST market's rally this week, which may reflect concerns that issuance could be hiked further in line with a redrafting of the FY2020 supplementary budget. The government had originally planned to make 300,000 cash handouts to households suffering significant hits to their income, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signaled on April 16 that he had agreed to a 100,000 universal handout as proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party's coalition partner Komeito. Paying 100,000 to each of Japan's roughly 126 million citizens would cost around 12.6 trillion, requiring an additional 8.6 trillion in fiscal resources after subtracting the envisaged 4 trillion cost of the scrapped (income-tested) 300,000 handout. Media reports have suggested that these funds are to be raised via a further increase in issuance of special deficit-covering bonds. The government still has over 30 trillion in frontloaded issuance of refunding bonds at its disposal, leaving ample room for depletion aimed at limiting the increase in market issuance. If the COVID-19 situation is resolved before the end of 2020 and the FY2021 budget is on a rough par with the initial FY2020 budget, then so-called \"calendar-based market issuance\" of JGBsat \"normal\" auctions with pre-announced offering amounts will need to be reduced by around 9 trillion, leaving quite a significant \"gap\" to be closed (see Exhibit 30). This gap will of course be even wider if market issuance is increased further to cover the 100,000 universal handout. Using frontloaded refunding bond issuance to cover the entire amount seems appropriate from a \"smoothing\" perspective, but if calendar-based market issuance does end up being hiked, we expect the additional issuance to be mainly compensated by short-end sectors based on recent discussions of investor absorption capacity at the Meeting of JGB Market Special Participants (only Japanese is available). Short end could be set to weaken We currently see a risk of underperformance at the short end (from TDBs through 2y JGBs) due to not only the aforementioned possibility of a further increase in issuance, but also increased uptake of the Bo)'s Loan Support Program and new Special Funds- Supplying Operations to Facilitate Corporate Financing regarding COVID-19 as social distancing measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus leave many private-sector firms short of funding.", "tokens": 388, "label": "medium"}

There will also be no incentive to buy bonds at yields below 0.1% for use as collateral given that the Bo)'s currently popular USD funds-supplying operations basically allow for banks to borrow the necessary JGBs at O.1% using their current account deposits as security.

Trade idea: Maintain NZGB 2s10s flatteners at 0.78 versus 2s10s swap steepeners at 0.60 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Different rates products are likely to react to the specific policies being pursued. For example, NZGBs are likely to react to a potential increase in government bond purchases while local government and credit would react more to an LSAP for private assets. As noted in Exhibit 38, our expectations are for forward guidance to be extended, a cheaper Term Lending Facility rate, various LSAPs, and a small receivers program. We think the forward guidance change and TLF rate change are unlikely to move the market much. The announcement of a credit facility as well as more LGFA purchases should put downward pressure on credit spreads too which we expect is the RBNZ's intended effect. The most interesting trade from our perspective though is in swaps and cash bonds. The New Zealand cash bond curve has steepened in recent weeks relative to the swaps curve (Exhibit 39). This was driven largely by the long end of the NZGB curve. Normally swap rates and the cash bond equivalent tend to move in tandem, but these two started diverging on March 23 the day the RBNZ announced its NZ$30bn asset purchase program.

So while maturities of 10 years and greater only accounted for 16% of the RBNZ's purchases, they account for a full 25% of outstanding bonds. 32 Morgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA We don't think this can persist forever, particularly if the RBNZ is going to purchase an additional NZ$20bn as we expect. If the RBNZ is going to get closer to the 50% of issuers limit, and it continues in this current dynamic, then it will reach 50% of individual issues faster in the front end than the long end, which would force it to extend the duration of its purchases.

We think that the decline in the 10-year swap rate is largely overdone.

{"text": "However, we think the RBNZ's swaps program would likely be concentrated in the front end with a maturity cap of perhaps three years to correspond with the TFL or perhaps its forward guidance. This is for three reasons. First, the RBNZ may not be willing to hold bank credit risk on its balance sheet for such a long period as, say, 10 years. Second, though, we think the swaps program would be used in part to reinforce its forward guidance. And third, we think the RBNZ would view swaps longer than that period as a potential risk to the public balance sheet. 33 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA After all, if the RBNZ entered into a swap receiving a fixed rate for ten years at the current rate of 0.71%, and then hiked the OCR in two years time to 1% and then kept rates on hold, the RBNZ would then be losing money for the duration of its swap. The alternative would be keeping rates lower than the RBNZ would prefer in order to protect the public balance sheet. Put another way, we don't think the RBNZ wants to be in a position later on where it must choose between the most appropriate OCR and potentially Losing taxpayer money. Thus, we think a 2-3 year maturity on swaps would be the sweet spot Long enough to reinforce its (likely extended) forward guidance, but not so long so as to put public funds at risk. This is why we think a swap steepener is attractive. The RBNZ through its program would anchor the front end while long-end swap rates would be able to rise along with a stabilization in risk appetite. The key risk to our rates trade is that the RBNZ fails to increase its NZGB purchases, which would keep the NZGB curve steep, or that the RBNZ enters into swap agreements with longer-than-expected maturities, which would keep the OIS curve flat. 34 Morgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA Currency & Foreign Exchange United States USD has almost universally weakened over the past two weeks, consistent with the improvement in risk sentiment.", "tokens": 352, "label": "medium"}

This buildup has been largely funded by bill issuance. In effect, if cash reserves at the Fed are rising, financed by bill issuance, it effectively counteracts the liquidity additions from the Fed's QE and liquidity programs. We think TGA may be volatile in the short term as bill issuance may further increase but payouts begin. However, over the coming weeks, we do anticipate TGA will fall, as payments pick up speed relative to bill supply.

By adding unprecedented amounts of USD Liquidity into the financial system - through asset purchases, repo operations, and various liquidity facilities - the supply of available USD liquidity would dwarf the demand for USD - sending the USD weaker over time. This is particularly true as USD demand has been driven as much by actual need as it was by lack of confidence (hoarding liquidity amid high uncertainty). Confidence in the Fed's actions, coupled with its actions themselves, should be sufficient to turn the tide. USD supply should exceed demand and not the other way around, first checking USD strength and eventually leading to its reversal. One factor that has caught our eye, though, is the marked growth in the Treasury General Account (TGA), or Treasury's checking account at the Fed.", "tokens": 153, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "TGA has grown to an unprecedented size, rising $400bn in the past two weeks alone. TGA has been rising as the Treasury has increased its issuance rapidly, particularly of cash management bills, to raise funds in anticipation of payouts associated with the PPP loan program. This is important because, if the Fed is adding liquidity by buying assets, and the Treasury is removing liquidity by selling assets, then no liquidity might be added on net. In a QE purchase, the Fed buys a Treasury note or bond from the market in exchange for newly created bank reserves. Normally, when the Treasury issues debt, it does so to fund spending - so it takes cash from creditors, which is deposited in TGA, but then is quickly transferred out of the TGA to pay for its various programs. The TGA is simply an intermediate step. But what if the funds never leave the TGA or sit there for an inordinate amount of time? From the perspective of the Fed's balance sheet, this is in effect QE in reverse. Let's say a primary dealer executes two transactions. First, the dealer sells $10O0mm Treasuries to the Fed in exchange for newly created bank reserves. Its balance sheet is now more liquid. Second, the dealer uses those reserves to buy a $100mm cash management bill from Treasury. Now, the dollar liquidity is gone. Exhibit 43 shows how total reserves in the system have increased relative to the TGA YTD. Due to the Fed's liquidity provisions, bank reserves have grown by roughly $1.5tn. However, TGA has grown by $500bn. In effect, TGA growth has offset about 25% of the Fed's liquidity provisions, and most of that has occurred in the past two weeks. 37 Morgan Stanley | kesearce IDEA Perhaps most concerning is that the rate of change in reserves growth is likely to slow while TGA growth might continue at its current pace. Over the past several weeks, the Fed has sLowed the pace of daily UST purchases from $75bn/day to $30bn/day, and will slow again to $15bn/day from April 20-24. The Fed has decreased, and will likely continue to decrease, its repo operations as well.

The timing of when these funds will be drawn is harder to pin down as many of these will be sent out as physical checks (which are likely to be sent out this week), and the timing of the drawdown is a function of when the recipient receives and cashes the check.

We anticipate further increases in issuance. Exhibit 46shows historical and expected bill issuance based on what the Treasury Department has already announced. Based on these figures alone, we expect another $110bn in net issuance of Treasury bills through 23 April. Of course, we should consider this a floor rather than a target, because Treasury can announce additional issuance of regular bills as well as cash management bills. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty as to the precise day to day movements in the TGA. While we anticipate greater issuance, it is not clear precisely on which days cash management bills will be offered and expectations can easily rise. At the same time, drawdowns may be driven more by the whims of the US Postal Service and American taxpayers and business owners than anything else. Still, what seems likely to us is that the overall trajectory for TGA balances is lower. Treasury has been raising cash for a reason - because it has bills to pay based on Legislation. So while there remains day-to-day uncertainty as to TGA's trajectory based on inflows (issuance and tax receipts) and outflows (payments), over time we anticipate a decline as the expected payments are made. Thus, for the USD, TGA growth might be a short-term headwind to USD weakness, but not a structural impediment. In fact, markets may be unprepared for what could very well be a large increase in excess liquidity. If TGA were to fall as quickly as it rose ($400bn in 10 business days), that would be the equivalent of the Fed purchasing an extra $40bn in assets per day - or roughly the size of its Treasury purchases every month during QE3. 39 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA We thus maintain our USD positions - recommending selling USD against AUD, JPY, and as of this week, CAD as well (see CAD | Selling USD/CAD to 1.34).

Recently EUR/USD has been relatively stable versus the fall in bank equities (Exhibit 49). The correlation between the two has changed over the years and there are two distinct phases. - 2008-2014 when the Fed was doing QE but the ECB was not: EUR/USD was positively correlated with bank equities. Investors buying Eurozone equities tended to buy FX unhedged. - 2014-lLate 2017 when the ECB started doing QE but the Fed was not: EUR/USD was initially inversely correlated with bank equities then the correlation faded. Investors buying Eurozone equities tended to buy FX hedged. The direction of the correlation was determined by whether global investors were buying Eurozone equities outright or with an FX hedge. From 2018 the correlation has turned positive again but is less strong. As both the Fed and ECB are doing QE at the same time, the expectations for a large move in either direction for EUR/USD are likely to be weaker now relative to 2014.

Adams, CFA David.S.Adams@morganstanley.com +] 212 761-1481 Andrew Watrous Andrew.Watrous@morganstanley.com +1 212 761-5287 In a recent note we describe how we expect the RBNZ to ease further by its May meeting and how to trade. We offer an abridged version here and summarize our suggested rates trades in the section above here. For the full note, see here: New Zealand: Does Orr Have More in Store? (16 Apr 2020). Trade idea: Buy AUD/NZD on dips, ideally at 1.02, targeting 1.08 When evaluating how to trade FX in anticipation of further RBNZ easing, we think there are two factors we need to focus on. First, what are the specific easing measures being pursued, and how correlated is NZD to those specific measures? Second, what is the totality of the easing being offered. This \"kitchen sink\" approach we think the RBNZ will pursue lends itself to more nuanced analysis. Put another way, the most NZD-bearish scenario would be if the RBNZ pursues an aggressive easing strategy in excess of net market expectations, but that the easing measures it most aggressively pursues are also those with which NZD is most highly correlated. Morgan Stanley | kesearce IDEA Exhibit 63 shows the three-month daily correlation of AUD/NZD to various macro variables. What seems clear from the data is that AUD/NZD is driven by two main forces: rate differentials and risk sentiment. More specifically, AUD/NZD tends to rise the most when New Zealand yields fall (in a bull flattening pattern) and when risk sentiment is positive (higher equities). If the RBNZ eases as we anticipate, we would thus expect AUD/NZD to rise. We expect the NZGB curve to bull flatten in response to our expected increase in NZGB purchases, which should be AUD/NZD positive based on the correlation analysis all else equal. 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 -0.2 -0.4 ZA2A 2A TUTDoTZETTETT TZ SSSSSESESES rm - 4 Lp - LP 222284352 re 2 C., P 3 2B _ oOo _ (oe) 2.", "tokens": 418, "label": "heavy"}

The BoC seems unwilling to increase its asset purchases in government bonds barring a market functioning breakdown, while we think more will be coming from the Fed, perhaps as early as the April meeting. Fed dovishness and peaking COVID cases may keep risk sentiment on a stabilizing path and equities supported, in turn weighing on USD/CAD. Crude oil has been having a less acute impact on USD/CAD of late, so falling oil prices absent falling equities is likely to be USD/CAD negative, not positive. Finally, positioning remains short CAD particularly in the options space. 48 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Trade idea: Maintain USD/CAD shorts at 1.4050 with a target of 1.3400 and stop of 1.4350 The BoC made it clear today at its meeting that it remains in \"liquification mode\" - meaning its asset purchases being conducted are being done for the purposes of ensuring that financial markets remain orderly and liquid.

We think the broader improvement in markets and market functioning is likely to persist and therefore view additional \"liquification\" purchases as unlikely for now. What about asset purchases to ease financial conditions and stimulate the recovery? Like the Fed, the BoC is thinking about asset purchases in two separate ways based on the intentions of the program - purchasing assets to add bank reserves to the system and aid market liquidity (a \"quantity based\" system), and purchasing assets to reduce borrowing costs, stimulate credit creation, and support economic growth (a \"price based\" system, focused on the price of credit). When asked about this latter type of easing, both Governor Poloz and Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins seemed to suggest that it is unlikely to happen anytime soon. This is because they seemed unconvinced that it would have the desired effect - while the economy remains in lockdown, lower borrowing costs are unlikely to stimulate demand for credit. They also emphasized that the Bank did not feel comfortable even providing a base case forecast given how much uncertainty there is about the outlook, and how much of the outlook is contingent on when the economic lockdown ends. Thus, we think \"price based\" easing, designed to lower borrowing costs and stimulate Loan growth, is unlikely to happen for at least a month or two, until it becomes clearer that the lockdown would be ending, and the Bank feels more confident in its projections. In short, so Long as market functioning continues to improve (or at least stay at current levels) and the Canadian and global economies remain on lockdown, we think there is limited risk of further expansion of the asset purchases until at least June.", "tokens": 300, "label": "medium"}

Such a program is likely to include substantial asset purchases (perhaps $150bn in Treasuries per month, compared to $45bn/mo in QE3), but also likely a much higher duration of asset purchases. 49 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Thus the program might be sort of a combination of a large scale asset purchase program and an \"operation twist\" designed to ease financial conditions by lowering long- term borrowing costs.

{"text": "On the other hand, despite reaching highs of 139bp in March, LIBOR-OIS has begun tightening. Tightening will likely continue as prime MMFs see more inflows and CP supply declines seasonally. The CPFF and MMLF will serve as effective backstops to CP-OIS and LIBOR-OIS, but they won't aid in further tightening at levels below their respective pricing. We believe that ultimately, LIBOR-OIS tightening will be limited by cheapening T- bills. As we show, the tighter the Ted spread, the more meaningful T-bill price action is for LIBOR. Therefore, we suggest maintaining UO FRA/OIS wideners vs 2y swap spread tighteners. Lastly, as EURIBOR and LIBOR change, a natural question arises as to how EUR XCCY will react. If a European bank intermediates USD funding via FX swaps, it can earn (LIBOR - EURIBOR - EUR xccy basis) - (OIS + 25bp) as the former term is the total USD funding cost that the bank can earn by lending USD via an FX swap and OIS + 25bp is the rate at which a bank can borrow USD from the ECB (per the FX swap Lines). Given that banks would reasonably expect a spread for this intermediation, if LIBOR continues to tighten and EURIBOR continues to widen, ultimately we would expect the EUR xccy basis to widen (i.e. go back towards O and potentially even negative again). Given this, as well as the fact that 3m EUR xccy basis is near all- time tights, we believe receiving 3m EUR xccy basis is likely to outperform. 62 Morgan Stanley | eesearcs MORGAN STANLEY & CO.", "tokens": 261, "label": "medium"}

However, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month EURIBOR maturities have reversed some of their stabilization seen in recent days, pushing Im3m, Im6m and 1m12 EURIBOR curves towards their steepest levels observed since most EURIBOR points began the process of climbing higher in March.

In other words, the rate of change in 3m EURIBOR fixes has become more pronounced relative to the changes in 6m and 12m EURIBOR in recent weeks.

{"text": "IDEA 63 Morgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA Why has EURIBOR spiked?", "tokens": 11, "label": "light"}
{"text": "There are many theories as to why the higher fixings have occurred including but not limited to substantial ramps in bill supply in the coming quarter most notably in France and Germany, a lack of support for financial CP/broader bank bond buying due to ECB exclusion from purchasing programs at a time that the health of the banking sector may be being questioned by market participants, higher repo rates due in part to a greater proportion of dealer balance sheets committed to larger sovereign issuance volumes, a reduction in money market fund AUM as highlighted by the ECB in the ECB Blog and a lack of access to cheap longer term funding from the ECB until the June TLTRO. While all of them may be contributing in some way to the higher fixings, we believe that a substantial portion is related to a combination of notably higher 3m implied yields for banks within the broader euro area/French CP space as well as EURIBORs construction. Specifically, 9 of the 18 panel banks contributing to EURIBOR are located in France (5) and Spain (4) suggesting some degree of inevitable geographic concentration even after accounting for calculation methodology that includes a 15% trim and minimum country concentration. Additionally, the vast majority of 3m EURIBOR contributions come from level 3 transactions, according to the latest EMMI transparency reports (Exhibit 81).", "tokens": 226, "label": "medium"}

The US markets are larger, more robust and have substantially better information, which allows market participants to more closely observe and track CP developments, which have been notably correlated with US Libor since the newer calculation methodologies were implemented. However, in Europe the market for CP is far smaller than it is in the US while also being fairly concentrated, with the vast majority of CP issuance located in France, a point again highlighted in the recent ECB Blog. Collecting robust observable data series in Europe that could be used as observable wholesale funding proxies for level 3 type submissions can therefore be a challenging task. 64 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA To work around this, we created a daily time series to proxy an average 3 month panel bank yield using 3 month BVAL yield curves for 10 European banks including a number of panel banks where we could source the data. Concentration by country is fairly consistent with the 18 panel banks contributing to EURIBOR given that the largest number of banks contributing to our series come from France and Spain. Interestingly, we found that our 3 month average panel bank yield series closely tracked 3m EURIBOR fixes in level terms since panel banks started to phase into the new calculation methodology in 2019. Additionally, the series tended to actually lead major directional moves in 3m EURIBOR fixes by a few days for both lower and higher fixings, including this most recent acceleration higher (Exhibit 82). However, at times the series implied lower fixes than actually occurred while at other times it implied higher fixes.

The series can also be updated during the month using weekly volume and yield reports (Exhibit 84 & Exhibit 85). We found that looking at the evolution of this series in combination with our proxy for an average 3m panel bank yield series proved to be fairly robust since weighted average 3m French CP yields were on average higher than EURIBOR when our 3m panel bank series implied Lower fixings and lower than EURIBOR at times when our 10 bank series implied higher fixings. In our view, spending a considerable amount of time focusing on developments in the French money markets is important for understanding 3m EURIBOR fixings because they are one of the few observable inputs one can track in Europe. 65 Morgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA And we think the ECB agrees with us about this since its own Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS) only uses two money market inputs among all of its European inputs the volatility of 3m EURIBOR rates and the spread between 3m EURIBOR and French treasury bills. What do the indicators say now? Currently, 3m yields continue to climb higher as of April 16th for the majority of the banks represented in our average 3m panel bank yield series (Exhibit 82), suggesting that if the relationship with 3m EURIBOR holds there may still be higher fixings before the market eventually stabilizes. Additionally, financial CP and the 3m yield structure for financials have no support from ECB buying programs while issuance in the 3m part of the yield curve is ramping in the sovereign space from larger volumes in France, Germany and the recent 3m BOT in Italy, in addition to consistent issuance from Spain. (In previous publications including The Flattener Goes for Gold and Airing Dirty Laundry, our US rates strategist have described the relationships between ramps in bill issuance, higher bill yields, commercial paper and money market fund flows. See further detail in our discussion of increased bill issuance in A Tale of Two IBORs. While its true that the ECB can buy a substantial portion of this issuance in the PEPP in order to slow or reverse the rise in bill yields, doing so would take away purchasing power from other parts of the market and may not be seen as the optimal usage of PEPP purchases given the current pressure on periphery spreads. Given this, we are not ready yet to suggest trades that look for stability and an eventual reversal of some of the deeply inverted calendar spreads seen in the whites/reds and whites/green of the 3m EURIBOR curve until we start to see stability in our average 3m panel bank yield series. Morgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA However, we think it's clear based on the inversion and curvature that markets believe higher fixings to be primarily a near-term phenomena that begins to normalize towards the end of the year. This may be due to a view that banks will have material access to longer term funding at the upcoming TLTRO in June or perhaps due to a view that bill issuance in the front end of the curve may be both temporary and front loaded once economies start to re-open.

{"text": "The only exception is the upper left corner where an unsettling Libor-OlS spread has played a prominent role in driving a marginally higher realized move in the spot rates.

Should the Libor-OlS spread tighten in the following months, we expect the whole term structure of realized vol to develop the same upward sloping shape in this current new ZIRP-QE regime. From an implied-realized perspective, despite current upper left implied vol trading at a premium to realized (Exhibit 96), it was actually the norm that short-end rates tended to have more implied vol premium to realize during the prior ZIPR-QE era (Exhibit 99). Whereas the chances of the forward-looking implied vol trading at above or below the backward-looking realized vol on the long end of the rates were closer to an even split (Exhibit 100).

{"text": "We are tactically neutral to marginally bullish but structurally bearish rate vol Previously in Lower vol, wider spreads, both with steeper curve (Apr 3, 2020), we revisited and adopted a quantitative framework for implied rate vol fair value and examined its efficacy in estimating implied rate vol during a ZIRP period. Specifically, we chose the 1ly10y vol point that has much less sensitivity to programmatic or structural flows compared to other points. We concluded that once the market settles in a ZIRP- QE regime: 1. A 2-factor regression model using the level of rate and the overall financial condition index in the US can demonstrate reasonable model consistency and statistical significance in explaining ly10y vol during the ZIRP period. 2. Qualitatively, the ly10y vol trade positively correlated with rate level (i.e., higher rates, higher vol; Lower rates, lower vol) and negatively correlated with overall financial conditions (i.e., tighter financial conditions, higher vol; looser financial conditions, lower vol). 3. Quantitatively, a 1m rolling regression provides statistical accuracy and efficiency in estimating ly1Oy implied vol on the following day. Once the market remains in this new regime for a period of time, we can use a Static set of coefficients run from the in-sample data to project rate vol in future periods under various rate level and financial condition scenarios. Notice here we use the Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index that tracks the overall Level of financial stress in the US money, bond, and equity markets. The composites include funding conditions (i.e., TED spread, LIBOR/OIS spread, CP/T-Bill spread), credit conditions (ie., BBB/IOy UST spread, HY/10y UST spread), and equity market conditions (.e., S&P500, VIX). In this report, we further expand the scope of analysis regarding our third point above. The bond market entered this new ZIPR regime just about a month ago. The previously analysis suggested to us that going forward we can start using a 1m rolling regression to estimate ly10y implied vol on the following day. However, we are not only interested in rate vol on the following day, but also rate vol during the following 1m, 6m, or ly period to derive trading implications in the short and intermediate term. So will the model have the capability to predict ly10y rate vol in the following 1m, 6m, or ly given a set of rate and financial condition scenarios? The short answer is yes.", "tokens": 393, "label": "medium"}

{"text": "Objective. The objective of this analysis to test if our quantitative framework has some capability to \"predict\" implied rate vol (ie., the coming 1m, 6m, or Ty's time) given a set of scenarios in the level of rate and the overall financial condition in the US. Methodology. For the 2-factor model, we run three sets of rolling regression: (1) 1m in- sample period vs 1m out-of-sample period, (2) 6m in-sample period vs 6m out-of-sample period, and (3) ly in-sample period vs ly out-of-sample period. For each set of regression, we use the coefficients of ly10y vol vs. the rate level and financial condition index calculated from the in-sample period (i.e. the most recent 1m, 6m, and Ty worth of data) to estimate the ly10y vol during the following out-of-sample period (i.e. the following 1m, 6m, and 1y period), assuming that the rate level and financial conditions during the 74 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA out-of-sample period are known. We then compare the actual and estimated ly10y implied vol. For example, on the day of Jan 1, 2011, we use coefficients calculated from regressions using data from Dec 1, 2010 to Jan 1, 2011 (i.e., the most recent 1m period), July 1, 2010 to Jan 1, 2011 (i.e., the most recent 6m period), and Jan 1, 2010 to Jan 1, 2011 (i.e., the most recent ly period) to estimate the ly10y implied vol from Jan 1, 2011 to Feb 1, 2011 (i.e., the following 1m period), Jan 1, 2011 to July 1, 2011 (i.e., the following 6m period), and Jan 1, 2011 to Jan 1, 2012 (i.e., the following ly period), respectively. We then compare the estimated ly10y implied vol against the actual during each corresponding out-of-sample period. Backtest period. Once again, we think the most relevant historical period to draw parallel with the current environment was the prior episode of global turmoil that was followed by a ZIRP-QE era, which was between 2008 and 2013 prior to the taper tantrum. In November 2008, the Fed took its policy rate to O and started the first round of its balance sheet expansion (QE1). Purchases were halted in June 2010 but resumed in August 2010 when the Fed decided the economy was not growing robustly. In November 2010, the Fed announced a second round of quantitative easing, buying $600 billion of Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011 (QE2). The third round was announced in September 2012. It was an open-ended bond purchasing program that had started with $40bn worth of monthly purchase but was later increased to $85bn monthly purchase in December 2012 (QE3).

{"text": "Exhibit 105, Exhibit 106, and Exhibit 1O7demonstrate the comparison of the actual vs. estimated ly10y implied vol from the 2-factor rolling regression model during the out-of-sample period for each set of regression windows (i.e., 1m, 6m, and Ty). We make the following observations and conclusions: 1. Estimated rate vol from the model tracks much better with the actual during the QE2 to QE3 period compared to QE1 across the three sets of regression. For example, the standard deviation of the distribution of model errors was 9.6% during QE1, 2.7% during QE2, and 2.3% during QE3 in the case of the 1m in-sample vs 1m out-of-sample regression. Notice that there is a 1% difference on a base vol of 100bp annualized, which is worth 1bp in normal terms. 2. During QE2 and QE3, all three sets of regression models provided close estimates of 1y10y vol relative to the actual. The standard deviation of the distribution of model errors was 2.7%, 2.8%, and 2.7% during QE2 for the 1m, 6m, and 1y rolling periods, respectively. During QE3, the corresponding numbers are 2.3%, 4.9%, and 2.8%. 3. The observations above indicate to us that once the market settles down in a ZIRP regime (i.e., once the market grows and is convicted that the short end of the curve will remain at around the effective lower bound for an extended period of time, and the Fed's LSAPs will be in place in a consistent and open-end nature), the estimation capability of the model increases significantly vs. the actual. 15 Morgan Stanley | sesearcs IDEA Exhibit 105: Actual vs. estimated 1y1 Oy vol: rolling regression of 1m in-sample and 1m out-of-sample 1y10y implied vol (bp) 180 eeeeeseeenseenteensaenennentns", "tokens": 282, "label": "medium"}

Our duration strategist maintains his expectation that the Fed will do two more rounds of QE: a 1 trillion UST/400bn MBS round to be announced soon (to continue to address Liquidity conditions) and a 3 trillion round with a focus on easing financial conditions, likely to be announced before or at the April FOMC meeting. We expect the second QE program to exert flattening pressure on the yield curve, while front-end yields remain near current Levels. Should this scenario be realized, a lower rate level in the back end and a gradual improvement in overall financial conditions are likely to further pressure the implied rate surface. We are tactically neutral to marginally bullish vol in the upper right. We think that the adequacy of the existing fiscal stimulus and monetary policy, as well as the expected path for both, remains uncertain, with the continuous evolution of the global pandemic. The reluctancy of taking policy rates to negative territory and an extended period of forward guidance from the Fed will most likely pin the front end. But for the long end of the curve, on one hand, a better risk sentiment and any surprise to the upside in the growth outlook could drive long-end rates higher; whereas on the other hand, further improvement in financial conditions and the Fed keeping term premium under control could function as a soft cap on long-end rates. A combination of the two would result in a whipsaw of the long-end rate, keeping upper right relatively supported. Exhibit 108: Actual vs.", "tokens": 320, "label": "medium"}

Then, we define whether the market movement is cyclical or secular in nature. A cyclical move is shorter term in nature, and a secular move is longer term in nature. For cyclical moves, we further divide them into tactical and strategic. We use daily data to inform tactical moves, and weekly data to inform strategic moves.

Trading Strategy 1 \"Trade Longs/Fade Shorts\" When the 5-day moving average crosses above the 20-day moving average, buy the futures contract (Long duration) and hold for a 25 business day period. When the 5-day moving average crosses below the 20-day moving average, buy the futures contract and hold for a 25 business day period. In short, this strategy buys futures when the Simple Moving Average Crossover (SMAX) generates both a Long and a short signal, given the historical outperformance of long signals traded long and underperformance of short signals traded short. Given that the SMAX could generate both a long and a short signal within the predefined holding period, an investor may have a 200% long position since each of the two signals would be traded in separate portfolio sleeves. Trading Strategy 2 Trade \"Longs Only\" When the 5-day moving average crosses above the 20-day moving average, buy the futures contract (Long duration) and hold for a 25 business day period. When the 5-day moving average crosses below the 20-day moving average, do nothing.

Risks to the steepener include the announcement of an additional QE envelope by the BoE, which would push back expectations for a period of larger supply without simultaneous BoE buying into 2021. Hints that the BoE could be willing to move the Bank Rate to zero or beyond could also lead to curve inversion. Risks to the trade include a resumption of persistent equity market weakness that leads to broader liquidation of less liquid names. Additionally, PGB could underperform should rating agencies decide to pursue downgrades, given its vicinity to IG status, led by market pricing.

We think Formosa issuance beyond 2020 will remain subdued compared to prior years. Keeping the sum of the forward and vol period at less than Sy will provide cushion to new issuance. 10-Jan-20 The trade construction takes advantage of the historically low implied forward vol and vanilla vs midcurve vol ratio to position for a rate range-bound scenario with positive carry and wide range of breakeven width 1-Dec-19 We expect high realized volatility vs implied given the uncertainty over US-China trade developments and US presidential election 1-Dec-19 Expiry vol term structure is upward sloping, reflecting minimal imminent risks and an on-hold Fed priced in by the market. The trade benefits from a deterioration in the global risk outlook and a surprising Fed cut in 1H20. The trade benefits from both a bull steepening of the Libor forward curve and an inversion of the vol term structure. 1-Nov-19 The vanilla vs midcurve vol spread is historically stretched. This forward vol point has the most positive vol carry along the current term structure. The relative skew is advantageous for a vanilla vs midcurve construction. The current macro backdrop is compatible to a range-bound scenario in the upper/intermediate left. 18-Oct-19 2y2s10s curve implied vol (corr) are currently trading at or close to historical lows (highs). Recent curve realized moves in forward space have outperformed the implied move. The trade positions for a near/intermediate-term Curve de- correlation move at a cheap upfront premium level. 27-Sep-19 Vol calendar on long tails are historically inverted, and this construction takes advantage of inversion and is set up fora wide range of positive outcomes relative to rate shifts. The dVega/dRate hedging dynamics from Bermudan book should also support the intermediate volatility if rates continue to fall. IDEA Intermediate to bottom right volatility is at The main risks are (1) a heavy issuance year of 2020 that is more than our $15bn projection and (2) a lack of demand for forward vol trade constructions. The main risks are: (1) a much softer implied volatility at 1y horizon and (2) if 1ly7y rate ends up outside of the 0.98% to 2.58% range. Very little move in underlying swaps and the subsequent sell off in vol The key risk to the trade is if the 3m Libor trades range-bound and the vol term structure becomes more upward sloping. The two main risks are: (1) if implied vol gradually drifts lower in the rate range-bound scenario and (2) if the short-end rate gaps lower by a large degree if the Fed is forced to lower its policy rate path aggressively. The main risk to the trade is the further softening in implied vol to below historically low levels. Two main risks are (1) if implied rate vol falls back to historically low levels at or Sub 50s; (2) if 20y swap rate reprices significantly higher than 2.65% or lower than 0.95%. 110 Morgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA Exhibit 163: History of recommendations", "tokens": 628, "label": "heavy"}

The institutional and historical analysis of the Soviet monetary management yielded the tasks of quantitative analysis. The quantitative analysis showed that the institutional division of cash and non-cash was effective, demand for cash was not predictable, and there was no significant relation between money and real production. This result suggested that the Soviet monetary management relying on some vague money supply target could not function well and only the control on wage which was supported by the division of cash and non-cash could weakly ceil money supply. A fundamental problem of the Soviet economy seemed that a mechanism to bridge between money and real economy was lacked, while money was used. It 1s, therefore, difficult to regard the Soviet economic system as an complete economic system equivalent to the market economy. 1. Introduction\nThe Soviet administrative command economy was the largest economic experiment in the twentieth century: the results of this experiment are a unique material to investigate an economic system as a whole. The opening-up of the Soviet archives greatly helped to understand the Soviet economic system (see Gregory, 2001; Gregory, 2004; Gregory and Harrison, 2005); many questions, however, remain still unanswered. The monetary management in the Soviet economy is one of those questions. Material planning, that is, administrative allocation of resources, was the main pillar of the Soviet economic system. Material planning restricted the role of money more or less; it did not, however, demise money. The passive money' concept summarized the role of money in the Soviet economy (see Baykov, pp. 414-5; Gregory, p.", "tokens": 394, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "192; Brus, pp. 65-83): Holding money was not sufficient to move economic resources; administrative permission was always necessary to transact resources except for in the sphere of household consumption. On the other hand, whenever economic resources were transacted, money moved according to the transaction. Because money 1/57 always followed the movements of resources, money was able to serve as a tool to monitor and control economic activities. This concept of passive money reflected the realities of money in the Soviet economy well. The concept, nevertheless, had some ambiguity: First, the concept of passive money said nothing about illegal economic transactions. The point noted here is not that how significant illegal economic activities were, but that the concept of passive money concerns the legal and institutional aspects of monetary management. Secondary, contrasting to the first point, the concept of passive money scarcely explained economic contents of the Soviet monetary management: what the concepts said was only that money moved legally and passively according to legal economic transactions. It 1s certainly different questions if a transaction is legal and if the transaction 1s economically rational.", "tokens": 183, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Even if a legal transaction is not economically rational, money will move legally according to the transaction. Assuming only that we do not have perfect foresight, allocations of resources are not always economically rational. This leads to the third ambiguity of the passive money concept: how the Soviet authority managed the legal but economically irrational movements of money? This consideration further leads to a fundamental question on the passive money concept: how we can understand the situation in which money had its economic value and, at the same time, money was passive. What that money has its economic value means that money has power to influence resource allocation. If money cannot influence resource allocation at all, it is not very meaningful to discuss monetary stability and monetary management. In the actual Soviet economy, monetary disequilibrium manifested itself as phenomena of queues, shortages, excess stocks, low productivity, vitalization of shadow economy, and social dissatisfaction. If material planning was revised to eliminate these phenomena, we may say that money could actively influence resource allocation and had economic value. The purpose of this study 1s to quantitatively examine how money was related to real economy, passively or actively, using monetary statistics which have become available recently. We will return to discussion on the validity of the passive money concept after the quantitative analysis. The scope of this study is limited to legal economic activities; illegal economic activities are not the subject of investigation. This is firstly because data needed to 2/57 investigate illegal economic activities are not available. Secondarily, it seems that we are able to find fundamental difficulty in the Soviet money management even if we limit our scope to legal economic activities. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews the historical and institutional aspects of the Soviet money management to make it clear what we should quantitatively analyze. Section 3 explains the data used for the quantitative analysis and reports the results of preliminary analysis of the data. Section 4 reports the findings and results of the quantitative analysis. Section 5 discusses the validity of the passive money concept and directions of the further research. 2. Soviet monetary management: history and institution Both Soviet and non-Soviet literature explains institutions and functions of the Soviet monetary management (Ikonnikov, 1954; Tochil'nikov, 1973; Alkhimov, 1981; Podshivalenko, 1983; Kravtsovaya, 1983; Garvy, 1972; Kuschepeta, 1978; Sigg, 1981). This section surveys the goal, the institution, and the targets and instruments of the Soviet monetary management to design the quantitative analysis. 2.1 The goal of monetary management Soviet literature claimed that the goal of the Soviet monetary management was the stability in the value of money and the Soviet planned economy, where one could directly control demand and supply of goods as well as prices of goods, could achieve the goal (see Baykov, 1970, p. 415; Ikonnikov, 1954, pp.", "tokens": 475, "label": "heavy"}

{"text": "25). On the other hand, non-Soviet scholars have discussed repressed or hidden inflation in the Soviet economy: they believed that monetary disequilibria occurred and caused various negative phenomenon including queues, shortages, and prosperity in black markets (Holzman, 1960; Grossman, 1963; Dyker, 1985, pp. 79-84; Birman, 1981). Systematic data which showed what the target of the Soviet monetary management was and how they intended to achieve the target were not available: in the first place, Soviet literature did not give a clear definition of the stability in the value of money. The Soviet authority, nevertheless, obviously recognized that monetary disequilibria could cause serious economic problems. This understanding seemed to be 3/57 based on not theoretical considerations but the experiences of hyperinflation during the periods of the war communism, the first years of the first five-year plan, and World War II. Additionally to those periods, they experienced hyperinflation during the latter half of the Perestroika period. It seems that the war communism and the first years of the first five-year plan were only the periods when the Soviet authority intentionally lowered the priority of the monetary stabilization: in the periods of World War II and the Perestroika, the Soviet authority was forced to compromise the monetary stability for the war financing and the acceleration policy of economic growth, respectively. We briefly survey the situation of the monetary management in those periods. The war communism was the period when the monetary stability was abandoned because of not only need for the war financing but also the belief in communist ideology (see Ikonnikov, 1954, ch. 5). The Imperial Russia suspended the gold standard in January 1914 to finance the costs of World War I. The Soviet government, which was in serious financial difficulty under the civil and interfering war, abolished in May 1919 all restrictions on banknote issue that still existed after the abandonment of the gold standard. In January 1920, the Soviet government abolished the banking system itself and started using governmental paper money only. The result of this policy was the hyperinflation and the barter economy. As the civil and interfering war was over, the economic policy of the war communism was regarded as unsustainable. The policy course was changed to the New Economic Policy, which reintroduced the elements of market economy. In October 1921, less than one year after its abolition, the banking system was reestablished. The reestablished Gosbank had right to issue banknotes subject to the issue guarantee and the limit on issue. After reintroduction of the banking system, monetary reform had been carried out during the period of 1922 to 1924. The eleventh party congress in 1922 set the principle of the monetary reform to stabilize the value of money by maintaining budget surplus and reintroduction of a gold-standard currency. Following this resolution, Gosbank issued \" 93% of the total wage were paid in kind around the beginning of 1921 (Kuschpeta, 1978, p. 28) * The name of the bank reestablished was the People's Bank of the RSFSR. Hereafter, Gosbank (Gosdurstvenyii bank: the state bank) is used to refer to the bank that was located at the center of the Soviet banking system, ignoring the accuracy of the name. 4/57", "tokens": 531, "label": "heavy"}

{"text": "Davies(2001, pp. 72-3) indicated that Pyatakov, who was the president of Gosbank in 1928, executed an inflationary policy to provide firms with funds almost without limitation to accelerate the industrialization. As negative influences of the inflation became clear, the policy was changed and Pyatakov was removed from his post in October 1930. After that, Gosbank followed a tight monetary policy: Gregory (2004, p. 228-9) noted that the Soviet authority wanted to keeping the growth rate of monetary supply with the real economic growth rate. Such tight monetary policy could not accommodate to rapid structural changes in economy at the Industrialization period. Most of senior managers in the Gosbank, who supported the tight monetary policy or the monetary policy in the time of the gold standard, were expelled during the Purge of 1936 to 1939; it was, however, not clear how the purge was related to dispute on monetary policy (see Davies, 2003). During World War II, money supply increased rapidly to finance the war efforts. The increase in money supply caused increase in prices both in the state sector and in the kolkhoz market. The Soviet monetary authority was cautious to the risk of excess liquidity held by rural households and the hyperinflation: this means that the Soviet monetary authority recognized that money might actively influence resource allocation (see CBR, 2007b; CBR, 2007c). A monetary reform was envisaged already during the war (CBR, 2007a). The monetary reform was carried out in 1947 after abolishing the rationing system and raising state retail prices: the reform was successful in restoring the monetary stabilization. In the 1947 monetary reform, the old-face ruble notes were exchanged with the new-face ones at the rate of 10 to 1. The amount of 5/57 households deposits less than three thousands ruble at the saving bureau (Seberkassa) kept the same amount at new ruble; household deposits over 3000 to 10,000 at old ruble were reduced to two thirds of its amount at new ruble; household deposits over 10,000 at old ruble were halved at new ruble. Business deposits were not revalued. Because the 1947 monetary reform did not include denomination, the nominal amounts of financial flows including wages and pensions remained unchanged. The Soviet official statistics did not do any adjustment to the values of the nominal indicators such as nominal net material products and average monthly wage before and after the 1947 monetary reform. As a matter of fact, the 1947 monetary reform was a vigorous action to reduce excess liquidity by confiscating horded currency and high-amount deposits. There is not much doubt on that the Soviet authority concerned over monetary destabilization. During the 1950s, the Soviet authority executed a policy which was to reduce consumer prices in order to increase real income (Nove, 1992, pp. 333-335, 354-358; Khanin, 2003). Consumer prices were increased in 1946 for abolition of the rationing in 1947; consumer prices showed a decreasing tendency afterwards. Industrial wholesale prices were increased as subsidies were decreased in 1949; they were reduced in 1950 and 1952. Money supply, however, grew low but continuously during the period from 1950 to 1960: The monetary authority (CBR, 2008) reported that 1t was contented itself so far with that money supply was controlled within the permissible range, but it was watching carefully the increasing tendency of money stock and, therefore, requested the planning and industrial authorities to increase retail sales in order to channel currency back to Gosbank. Inflation occurred in the Perestroika period (see Ellman, 1992). One important cause for the inflation was to finance budget deficits by Gosbank credit. At the same time, price control was weaken as private economic activities were allowed. Apart from the judgment if the economic policy in the Perestroika period was appropriate, it was understandable that the Soviet authority gave priority to continuation of the Soviet system over the monetary stability. This survey showed that the stability of the value in money was at least one of the goals of the Soviet monetary management. 2.2 Institutional background of the Soviet monetary management The main institutional pillars of the Soviet monetary management were the 6/57 mono-bank system, the ban on commercial credits and the restricted provision of bank credit, the division of cash and non-cash money flows, and the foreign exchange monopoly. The key institutional framework of the monetary management was formed at the 1930/32 credit reform? and have remained basically unchanged until the collapse of the Soviet system. We survey the institutional framework of the Soviet monetary management focusing on money supply channels.", "tokens": 751, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The basic elements of the mono-bank system were rejection of the two tire banking system, concentration of banking operations in Gosbank, and assigning each firm to one and only bank branch office. Gosbank was only bank through the Soviet era. Until the end of the New Economic Policy, there were various banking institutions. Gosbank was, however, the dominant bank at that time, which performed both commercial and central banking services. Gosbank's performing both commercial and central banking services was not a socialist invention but a tradition form the Imperial State Bank (Gurvy, 1972, pp. 882-3). Even after the 1930/32 credit reform, there were other banks including the foreign trade bank and some sectoral banks. The foreign trade bank had performed solely foreign exchange operations and almost nothing to do with domestic banking. After the 1930/32 credit reform, the sectoral banks have performed long-term credit service only; the long-term credit service was actually to administer investment funds which were financed by the state budget and disbursed to the specific spheres including housing construction and agricultural cooperatives. There did not exist a commercial bank - central bank relationship between Gosbank and the sectoral banks. Gosbank performed all of short-term credit service and all settlement operations. All firms had transactional relationship with Gosbank through Gosbank's settlements service, while each firm was S The major decrees and resolutions dated on 30 January 1930, 14 January 1931, 20 March 1931, 23 March 1931, 21 October 1931, and 5 May 19329 931.3.20 are printed in Reshenya (1967, vol.2). Capital investments and increases in prescribed liquid assets in the state corporate sector were directly financed by the state budget. The 1965 economic reform introduced long-term bank credit as a financing source for the state capital investment projects for the first time (Resheniya, vol. 5, 1968, pp.", "tokens": 299, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "658-685, Art.", "tokens": 2, "label": "light"}
{"text": "41). The share of the long-term credit in the total amount of the state capital\ninvestments remained around five percent even in the 1980s (Podshivalenko, 1983, p. 66). 7/57 allowed to open its bank account only one Gosbank branch office. This scheme gave Gosbank a possibility to monitor all individual transactions of all firms. The ban on commercial credit was an instrument to increase Gosbank's ability to monitor firms. Short-term credits provided by Gosbank replaced commercial credits; at the same time, granting short-term credit was restricted. Gregory and Tikhonov(2000) and Gregory(2003, pp. 224-6) reported that Gosbank granted credits almost freely at firms' demands occurred at the first stage of 1930/32 credit reform. This caused the inflation in the first years of the 1930s. Facing the unexpected outcome, the initial concept of the credit reform was revised: short-term credits were granted to cover only financial needs difficult to be forecasted and standardized, such as outlay related to seasonal fluctuations and to goods under transportation and settlement. The loans should be secured with material collaterals and using borrowing funds for purposes other than the prescribed was prohibited. Therefore, the item of loan was changed from loan to work-in-progress goods, to loan to finished goods, to loan to goods on transportation, and finally to loan to goods on settlement as the production process advanced within a firm (Smirnov, 1982, p. 40). While use of bank loan was restricted, the interest rate was uniformly fixed and terms of loan were not differentiated by firm. Supply and demand for bank loan was adjusted administratively: Gosbank allocated quotas by item of loan to each firm on applications from the firm. The basic idea of the Soviet credit system was that the financial needs of the firms should be covered by the state budget (see Baykov, 1970, pp. 407-8); short-term credit was regarded as a subsidiary financial source. Commercial credit was banned; it, however, continued to exist in the forms of accounts receivable and payable after the 1930/32 credit reform through to the collapse of the Soviet system (Gregory, 2003, pp. 226-31; Nakamura, 1984). These inter-company credits accounted for 13 to 20% of the liquid assets financing of the state enterprises. On the other hand, the state enterprises in the heavy industry scarcely used bank credits until the latter part of the 1950s. It was relatively easy to forecast and standardize the demands for liquid funds in the heavy industry sector; these financial Narkhoz(1968, p. 862; 1981, p.511; 1991, p. 27) indicated that the inter-company credit accounted for 20%, 14%, 13%, 23.5%, and 23.1% of the liquid asset financing of the state firms at the end of 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990, respectively. 8/57\nneeds were financed by the budget money. Use of bank credit started to expand in the heavy industry sector in the latter part of the 1950s when the policy course was changed to a more flexible short-term credit supply (Rotleider, 1979, ch. 15). The purposes of increasing the flexibility of short-term credit were as follows: First, the switch from budget financing free from principal and interest repayments to credit financing with obligations of repayment was expected to increase efficiency of funds use. Second, flexible financing was expected to eliminate the financing sources that were out of Gosbank control, such as inter-company credit and funds allocation among corporations by order of the higher industrial administrative organizations (see Davies, 1953; Shenger, 1961, p. 225-230; Gregory and Tikhonov, 2000). A bank loan facility (kredit po oborot) which grew in use around the 1965 economic reform boosted to use of bank loan by the state enterprises. The loan facility was similar to the overdraft account: material collaterals to the loan were not required, the object of the loan was not specified, and temporal overdrawing was allowed. The introduction of this loan facility, however, resulted in a deterioration of the financial discipline of corporations. The use of the facility was restricted in the latter half of the 1970s; the 1979 economic reform (see Resheniya, vol. 13, p.", "tokens": 670, "label": "heavy"}

The division of cash and non-cash money flows represented the following institutional setting: the transactions of the household sector were settled by cash money, while all other transactions by account transfer by each transaction. Gosbank obtained a possibility to monitor each transaction of the corporations and could limit cash money circulation to the sphere of household transactions. Because of this institutional setting, the corporations did not need to transact cash money except for wage payments and proceeds from retail sales.

The Soviet authority highly relied on the effectiveness of the division of cash and non-cash money flows: Savluk (1982, pp. 156-7) wrote that the relation between cash and non-cash money flows and its possible influence on the monetary management were not considered at all until to the 1950s. The division of cash and non-cash money flows, however, could not mean that there was no economic relation between cash and non-cash money. If we consider illegal and law-circumventing activities, the corporations could convert their non-cash funds into cash money through the Soviet era (Gregory, 2004, pp. 220-221). Even if we consider only the legal activities, cash and non-cash money flows were interacted. When the corporations withdrew cash, they needed to have had non-cash funds (Shenger, 1961, p. 102): the cash flow depends on funding situations of the corporation itself and its partner corporations.

{"text": "6). The corporations were not allowed to transact foreign exchange and foreign currency even when they did export and import; there was, therefore, no need for the corporations to exchange foreign currency with ruble. Because there was no need to exchange foreign currency except for tourism, there was no foreign exchange market and no exchange rate. This administrative separation between the flows of foreign exchange and ruble closed another money 10/57 supply channel, along which exchange of foreign currency caused changes in the volume of ruble supply. It was difficult to find any evidence that the Soviet authority considered the exchange ratios of ruble to foreign currencies as a important factor in monetary management. Although there was no market exchange rate in the Soviet economy, it was possible to calculate an ex post ratio of the foreign sales price to the domestic procurement price of an export good (see Marer, 1985, 28-33; IMF et al., 1991, vol. 1, pp. 421-430). The Soviet authority might use the information of this conversion ratio for the monetary management. CBR(2008, p. 62) revealed that the Soviet authority set the gold parity of the 1961 ruble at about one twenty-second of that of the before 1961 ruble in order to reduce an export subsidy of 33 billion Ruble on the 1961 annual economic plan to 7 billion; on the other hand, the conversion ratio of the new ruble to the old ruble was 10 to 1 at the 1961 denomination. So far as this change in the gold parity altered the Gosbank balance sheet, it might influence the domestic money supply; this change in the gold parity, however, seemed relevant not to the monetary management but to the fiscal policy. In the rest of this paper, we assume that the Soviet authority did not consider external purchasing power of ruble as a factor in monetary management. The review on the institutional design of the Soviet monetary management indicated that there existed only the money supply channel of wages payments, assuming the fiscal discipline and the foreign exchange monopoly. 2.3 Final target, intermediate target, and instruments The Soviet authority pursued the monetary stability in the institutional settings of monetary management described above; it was, however, not clear how the monetary stability was defined. Early Soviet economics textbooks like the Institute edition (1962, chs. 26 and 32) claimed that the value of ruble was secured because the gold parity of ruble was set. This view was, however, not acceptable: ruble was neither gold coin nor gold-convertible note. In the system of managed money where money itself ( in the forms of paper note, electric signal, and so on) did not contain economic value, the stability of value in money is defined in relation with price index, exchange rate, and interest rate. The value in money itself, therefore, cannot serve as an operable target of 11/57 the monetary management. The intermediate targets, which can be controlled by policy instruments, are necessary to attain the final goal of monetary stability. In the Soviet economy, money supply was controlled through 'the balance method of money circulation management (Kravtsovaya, 1983, p. 145). The balance method meant that cash money circulation was planned and managed being based on the balance tables including 'the monetary income and outlay balance of the household sector, 'the cash flow balance of the Gosbank', and 'the balance of bank credit. This sub-section discusses what the intermediate targets in the Soviet monetary management were and which policy instruments they intended to use to achieve the intermediate targets. The monetary income and outlay balance (Table 1 (A)) was a part of annual economic plan; the national planning agency, Gosplan, was in charge of compilation of both prospective and report balances in the annual and quarterly terms. The change in household deposits was an item of outlay in the balance; the closing item was the change in cash money hold by households. As cash money was circulated only in the sphere of household transactions, the monetary income and outlay balance comprised all cash transactions.", "tokens": 674, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The cash flow balance (Table 1 (B)) was a document for Gobanks cash operation. The cash flow balance was not a part of the annual economic plan; it should be, however, approved by the council of ministers (Ikonnikov, 1954, p.", "tokens": 40, "label": "light"}
{"text": "35; Alkhimov, 1981, p.", "tokens": 4, "label": "light"}
{"text": "43). All unit of the Gosbank network, from the headquarter to the terminal branch offices, compiled the monthly, quarterly, and annual cash flow balances to avoid excess and deficiency of cash money by them. The most important source of information for a Gosbank branch office to compile the cash flow balance was the cash plans of the enterprises and organizations which have their accounts at the branch office. It was obviously impossible to foresee all cash flows perfectly: cash flowed not as foreseen because the economy moved not as planned. Excesses and deficiencies of cash occurred at branch offices; these excesses and deficiencies of cash money should be managed firstly by the cash reserves held by the branch offices and secondarily by accommodation with cash by the higher units in the Gosbank network. If the Gosbank headquarter was in short of cash, the new banknotes would be emitted. As Table 1 (B) 9 Kravtsovaya (1983, p. 151-53) showed an example of the cash balance of an corporation. 12/57 shows, the closing item of the cash flow balance of the Gosbank headquarter was changes in cash money issued. Guarantee was required for banknote issues and the council of ministers set the upper limit on issue for each quarter. The credit balance (Table 1 (C)) was another Gosbank's operational document. Because of the requirement for guarantee of issue, a banknote issue should be accompanied by a corresponding increase in asset of Gosbank, mostly an increase in loans given by Gosbank. The cash flow balance and the credit balance were interacted in this way; Soviet literature, however, mentioned little about what relation existed between the two balances in the actual operation (see Kuschpeta, 1978, pp. 173-175). The reason for this ignorance was probably the trust in the division of cash and non-cash flows: the permitted amount of wage imposed a ceiling on cash money supply, irrelevantly to the amount of loan given by Gosbank. The Soviet authority attached importance to controlling households cash demand and, therefore, to the monetary income and outlay balance. The Soviet monetary theory defined the amount of cash money that the household sector needed to transact goods and services in a period as 'the required amount of money in circulation: they claimed that the monetary stability would be attained by supplying cash money to the amount no more and no less than this required amount. It was, however, doubtful how much information on the required amount of money in circulation or the optimal money supply the monetary income and outlay balance could provide. First, the prospective balance of monetary income and outlay could be closed in many ways: Gosbank complained that it was not clear which should be adjusted, retail sales, consumer prices, supply of consumer goods, or wage, to compile the prospective monetary income and out lay balance and the cash flow balance for the 3rd five-year plan (CBR, 2007c). Second, we needed to quantify the change in the amounts of cash money and deposit held by households in order to establish an operational target for issue or absorb of money. Third, even if the target for money supply was established using the framework of the monetary income and outlay balance, the target seemed far from operable because the target might indicate the end-period change in money in circulation. The end-period target for money supply gave not much information how much money should issue or absorb day by day if we consider regional and temporal fluctuation in demand for money. Actually, there existed only all-Union balance of 13/57\nmonetary income and outlay of the household sector until 1959; the republic balances were not compiled until then (Kravtsovaya, 1983, p. 143). Even after 1959, the regional balances included only the Al and A2 parts of Table 1(A), because it was not possible to forecast the amount of cash transactions within the household sector and the magnitude of inter-republic migration of people, goods, and money (Tochil'nikov, 1973, p. 284-5; Ischshenko, 1983, p.285). The fact that the republic head offices of Gosbank were authorized to supply cash money over the amount stipulated in the prospective cash flow balance probably reflected the difficulty in foreseeing demand for money (Tochil'nikov, 1973, p. 299). It seemed difficult to deduce the optimal money supply from the monetary income and outlay balance; the Soviet authority, nevertheless, seemed to establish a target for money supply somehow, because there seemed to be no other criteria which could be used for monetary management. Soviet literature was vague at this point how to establish an operational target of money supply, while it stressed on the concept of the required amount of money in circulation. The money supply target might be calculated being based on real national income (see Gregory, 2004, p. 228-9), total wage, total monetary income of the household sector, or a mixture of these indicators under the assumption of constant velocity of money (Kuschpeta, 1978, pp. 164-6).", "tokens": 819, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The next question is how the Soviet authority intended to achieve the money supply target. Soviet literature emphasized the role of the limit on banknote issue, that is, the direct control on money supply; Soviet literature was, however, ambiguous again about how the issue limit functioned as a tool of monetary management. Although Soviet literature scarcely discussed the relation between the balances of cash flow and monetary income and outlay, it seemed that these balances were closely related in the planning process (Ikonnikov, 1954; Tochil'nikov, 1973; Kravtsovaya, 1983). The balance of monetary income and outlay gave a rough estimation of changes in money supply and this estimation was probably related to establishment of the limit on banknote issue. The prospective balance of cash flow was probably compiled so that the volume of banknote issue on the balance was kept within the limit. It is, however, doubtful if imposition of a issue limit was an effective instrument of monetary management. For Japan, Bank of Japan law, which was enacted in 1941 after Japan's transition from the gold-standard to the managed money system, 14/57 required guarantee for banknote issue and imposed a limit on banknote issue. Both the guarantee requirement and the limitation of banknote issue were abolished when new Bank of Japan law was enacted in 1997: the reasons for the abolishment were as follows (FSA, 1999). First, it was not possible to establish a method to calculate the optimal limit of banknote issue. Second, it was not clear what kind of significance it had to stop banknote issue when demand for banknote existed. It had been a customary practice in Japan that banknotes had been issued over the limit and the revision of the limit was authorized following the fact. If the limit of banknote issue should be kept, the simplest way to achieve it was to follow the balances of monetary income and outlay and the cash flow balance as they planned. Soviet literature indeed emphasized control of wage payments, the main balance item of cash disbursement, and of retail sales, the main balance item of cash receipt. The control of wage payments and retail sales, however, could not be an effective instrument of monetary management. Gosbank had authority to change neither the amount of wage payments nor the production volumes and the prices of consumer goods. Moreover, it seemed theoretically groundless and practically infeasible to change wage and retail sales in order to keep the planned balances and the limit on banknote issue, as 1t was in Japan. In summary, keeping the limit on banknote issue through controlling wage payments and retail sales did not seem an effective method to attain monetary stability, even under the institutional framework of the Soviet monetary management. 'The balance method of managing money circulation might be rather a scheme being based on the following simple idea: 1f you absorbed through retail sales so much cash money as disbursed through wage payments, cash money could not circulate excessively. The idea was logically true and fairly realistic during the time when people accepted any consumer goods and services offered.", "tokens": 515, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "It was, nevertheless, not considered almost at all what the monetary authority to do in the cases like that retail sales could not absorb cash money sufficiently. 2.4 Task of the quantitative analysis The Soviet authority intended to achieve monetary stability through keeping the limit on banknote issue and controlling wage payments and retail sales. It, however, seemed inevitable that the limit on banknote issue and the planned amounts of wage and 15/57\nretail sales differed from their actual figures, simply because the plan was based on forecasts and expectations. Table 2 showed that the actual achievement differed from the plan: the Soviet 'planned' economy did not move as it was planned. If the plan and the achievement always differed, then adherence to the prospective balances and the planned limit on banknote issue would not be very meaningful. Occurrence of monetary disequilibria in a sense that the actual figures differed from the planned figures seemed inevitable as well. On the other hand, the Soviet economy institutionally excluded the information sources such as price indexes, interest rates, and exchange rates to analyze the situation of monetary economy and to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of policy instruments used'. Moreover, the institutional settings of the Soviet economy circumscribed the possibility of the monetary authority to exercise the policy instruments including open-market operation, reserve requirement, and money rates operation. In the Soviet administrative command economy, monetary disequilibria would be recognized through the phenomena of shortage of consumption goods, queuing, increase in household deposits and hoarded money, and thriving black markets; the only way to deal with the phenomena might be to change the material planning including the amount of wage and the volumes and prices of consumer goods. If this was true, money influenced the real economy. In the following sections, we investigate quantitatively the relation between the monetary and real sides of the Soviet economy. The opening-up of the Soviet archives significantly improved the availability of the Soviet monetary data, the available Soviet monetary data are, nevertheless, too scarce to fully investigate the function and performance of the Soviet monetary management. We limit our quantitative analysis on the following points: First, we inspect the division of cash and non-cash money flows. If this division would not be effective, it would mean that a money supply channel, through which supply of non-cash funds increased cash money, was still opened. If it would be the case, the Soviet monetary management depending solely on control of the cash money circulation would not be functioning. 0 Levchuk(1971, pp. 129-30), a Soviet economist, recognized already in the beginning of 1970s that the lack for means to monitor the influences of monetary fluctuations on the economy was the problem. 16/57\nSecond, we examine if it was possible to forecast demand for cash money. The Soviet monetary management relied on keeping the money supply target through limiting banknote issue and controlling wage payments and retail sales. The precondition for functioning of this monetary management system was that the demand for cash money was more or less predictable. To keep inappropriate limits and targets were not meaningful. To access the predictability of demand for money, we estimate regression models which probably reflect the Soviet planning custom: It is known that a simple rule that an increment was added to the achieved level in the last period was extensively adopted in the Soviet planning practice (Birman, 1978; Dyker, 1985, pp. 1-8; Gregory, 2004, pp.", "tokens": 573, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "209-212). Finally, we investigate the relation between money supply and real economy. We use Vector Auto-regression (VAR) models and Vector Error Correction (VER) models to statistically identify the relation between money supply and the real economy. This analysis concerns the predictability of demand for cash money as well; it 1s, however, improbable that the Soviet monetary authority used VAR and VEC models to predict demand for cash money. 3.", "tokens": 69, "label": "light"}

If a structural change in trend exist, the power of the unit root test is lowered. Perron's unit root test (1989), which took the structural change in account, was additionally done for DD, DPO, and CS. The basis of Perron's test 1s to perform the ADF test on the detrended series. The results of Perron's test showed the ADF statistics of -3.88, -2.61, -4.67 for the detrended DD, DPO, and CS, respectively. According to the Perron's table for model (C) (Perron, 1989, pp. 1336-7), the detrended DD and DPO were level non-stationary at the 5% significance level, while the detrended CS was stationary at the 5% significance level. DD and DPO were, therefore, regarded as the difference stationary series, while we needed to consider the possibilities that CS was level or difference stationary. 3.2 Preliminary analysis of the data This sub-section reports the results of preliminary visual inspection on the data, focusing on the newly available data, household monetary income (DD) and cash money in circulation (NDVO). The nominal series, NNMP, DD, NDVO, and CS, showed the common pattern that the increasing trend was strong before the war and weak afterwards (see Appendix Chart 1). Table 4 indicates a high correlation between these nominal indicators. gNNMP, gDD, gNDVO, and gCS, which represent the changes in the corresponding indicators, also showed a common pattern: they had a decreasing trend and relatively large fluctuations before the war and showed no clear tendency and relatively small fluctuations afterwards (see Appendix Chart 2). gNDVO appeared at first sight to move somewhat differently from the other series; gNDVO, however, also shared the common pattern, if we excluded the large changes caused by the 1924 monetary reform, the 1947 monetary reform, and the 1960 denomination. 18/57\nDD and NNMP appeared to move closely together; the ratio of DD to NNMP, DD/NNMP, however, changed (Chart 1). In the periods before the war, DD/NNMP fluctuated largely: the ratio sharply increased during 1925 to 1932, then it sharply decreased during 1933 to 1935. DD/NNMP sharply increased again in 1942 and the ratio stayed over one during 1943 to 1945. DD/NNMP can be larger than one, because DD includes withdrawals of hoarded money and deposits. Appendix Chart | indicated household deposits (DPO) decreased, while cash money in circulation (NDVO) increased during 1941 to 1943. It was probably true that DD/NNMP was at the high level at that time; it, nevertheless, seemed implausible that DD/NNMP remained higher than one in the three consecutive years.", "tokens": 500, "label": "heavy"}

The ratios of cash money in circulation to household monetary income (NDVO/DD) and to nominal net material product (NDVO/NNMP) moved similarly as DD and NNMP showed a common pattern of the movements. An increasing trend in NDVO/DD was seen since the latter half of the 1930s. The increasing trend was interrupted at the 1947 monetary reform, at the 1961 denomination, and in the years around 1980; the influences of these events, however, did not last. NDVO/NNMP moved slightly differently from NDVO/DD before 1945; NDVO/NNMP. and NDVO/DD showed the similar increasing tendency after 1960. The ratio of NDVO to real net material product (NDVO/RNMP) showed an increasing tendency before 1941; the ratio, however, stagnated during 1932 to 1936. These movements of NDVO/RNMP matched the development of monetary policy in the period described in Sub-section 2.1. NDVO/RNMP outstood during 1941 to 1947, reflecting the war-time inflation. NDVO/RNMP sharply decreased after the 1947 monetary reform and continued to decrease to 1960. The tendency turned upward after 1961; in the latter half of the Perestroika period, NDVO/RNMP increased at a speed comparable to that in the war time. 19/57", "tokens": 233, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Chart 2 compared NDVO, DPO, Broad Money (M1), and Bank Loan (CRD). DPO was almost one tenth of NDVO around 1930, exceeded NDVO in 1954, and was about three times larger than NDVO in the final years of the Soviet system: DPO increased much faster than NDVO. The overall tendencies were, nevertheless, common in NDVO and DPO, except for a large decrease in NDVO at the 1947 monetary reform. DPO showed a small increase in 1947: this may support the Soviet authority's claim that the magnitude of the confiscation of household deposits at the 1947 monetary reform was small. Because the patterns of the movements in NDVO and DPO generally matched, M1, which was defined as the sum of NDVO and DPO, moved also similarly to NDVO and DPO. 20/57\nChart 3 showed the ratios of CRD to NDVO, to DPO, and to M1. CRD/NDVO was around 0.6 and almost unchanged during 1950 to the middle of 1970s, excluding a decrease in 1954 and a pinnacle in 1960. The decrease in 1954 may be related to the introduction of differentiated loan terms; the decrease in NDVO at the 1961 denomination may cause the increase in CRD/NDVO in 1960. CRD/NDVO started to increase in 1975, showed a sharp increase in 1981, remained at a high level during 1981 to 1985, then decreased rapidly after 1986. Chart 1 indicates that CRD/NDVO increased in 1981 because CRD grew faster than NDVO in 1981. On the other hand, the decreasing tendency in CRD/NDVO after 1986 reflected that NDVO grew rapidly in the period while CRD decreased. The cause for the different movements between NDVO and CRD after 1980 was not clear. The ratio of bank loan to broad money (CRD/M1) had a decreasing tendency except for a small rise around 1980: this was the consequence of that DPO grew faster than CRD after 1950 excluding a few years (see Appendix Chart 2). The visual inspection suggested that the division of cash and non-cash flows was effective in the sense that CRD did not appear to increase NDVO and M1. We quantitatively inspect this point in the following section. As discussed in 2.3, the Soviet authority seemed to pursue for keeping the growth rate of cash money supply (gNDVO) within the range from zero to the growth rate of household monetary income (gDD). Keeping gNDVO at zero means that Gosbank collects all cash money disbursed from Gosbank in a period within the same period. If gNDVO 1s set at gDD, then it 1s: _NDVO,, DD tl ADD =ANDVO,\nwhere Ax denotes the time differential of the before-log-transformed variable x: x;-x1.1 and Ax/x1.~gx. Setting gNDVO at gDD, therefore, means to supply additional cash money (ANDVO), considering the money circulation velocity defined as DD,.1/NDVO,., and the increase in DD (ADD). Household deposits (DPO) is an important factor to control cash money. An increase in DPO was a redemption of cash money, while DPO was easily monetized. There was no doubt that the Soviet authority was cautious with increase in DPO (see CBR, 2008), while Soviet literature gave little information on how to control household deposits and how to deal with unintended changes in household deposits. Whatever 21/57 intention the Soviet authority had, it seemed difficult for the Soviet authority to manage household deposits. There was no reliable and effective policy instrument to control households deposit excluding the de-facto confiscation at the 1947 monetary reform and the de-facto forced purchase of government bonds by households that existed until 1957 (see Sychev and Boldyrev, 1984, p. 250)\"\".", "tokens": 588, "label": "heavy"}

Chart 4 shows the ratios of ANDVO and AMI to DD (ANDVO/DD and AM1/DD) and the ratios of the growth rates of NDVO and M1 to the growth rate of DD (gNDVO/gDD and gM1/gDD). Note that ANDVO and AMI are the flow amounts. ANDVO/DD seemed to fluctuate largely before the 1947 monetary reform. After 1947 until the latter half of the Perestroika period, ANDVO/DD appeared to fall in a certain narrow range. On the other hand, AM1/DD increased exceeding ANDVO/DD after 1947: this reflected that the weight of household deposits in M1 had rapidly increased after 1950. AM1/DD dropped in 1964 and in 1980 to 1982. The causes of these decrease were not clear. The visual inspection on ANDVO/DD and gNDVO/gDD showed that they were fairly stable except for the sporadic large changes; the cash money stock, NDVO, \" The year-end amount of government bonds hold by households was 5.7, 6.6, 4.6, and 3.4 times larger than the year-end amount of household deposits in 1940, 1950, 1955, and 1957, respectively (RGAE, F1562/041/E233/L134). 22/57 nevertheless, grew more rapidly than household monetary income, DD.

{"text": "To examine the effectiveness of the division between cash and non-cash money flows, Vector Auto-regression (VAR) and Vector Error Correction (VEC) models including two variables, cash money in circulation (NDVO) and bank loan (CRD), were estimated. It would be better to discuss the effectiveness of the division in a wider model of interactions between the monetary and real economies; it was, however, not possible mostly because the CRD series started in 1949. From the econometric perspective, the shortness of the series inevitably reduce the power of cointegration test and the reliability of VAR and VEC models. From the economics perspective, the shortness of the CRD series may not be a serious problem if we limit our analysis to the division between cash and non-cash flows, because the institution of the division between cash and non-cash flow was established after the 1930/32 credit reform. First, gNDVO-gCRD two variables VAR models were estimated. Setting the max lag length at 5, all lag order criteria, LR, FPE, AIC, SC, and HQ, indicated the lag order of 1 for the models including the constant term and the lag order of 2 for the model without the constant term. Both VAR models showed a poor fitness: only the constant terms and the own auto-regression terms were significant at the 5% level in each regression equation of both VAR models. Granger causality test on the VAR model with the lag order of 1 showed that Granger causality from gCRD to gNDVO was significant at 10% level; the Ganger causality from gNDVO to gCRD was rejected. Granger causality test on the VAR model with the lag order of 2 showed that gCRD and gNDVO did not Granger-cause each other. The VAR model with the lag order of 1 showed a possibility that non-cash 23/57\nmoney influenced cash. The impulse response analysis of the VAR model with the lag order | indicated, however, that gCRD inversely influenced gNDVO: an increase (decrease) in gCRD caused a decrease (increase) in gNDVO. The cumulative response of gNDVO three periods after a one standard-deviation shock in gCRD was -0.022 with Cholesky order from gNDVO to gCRD and -0.025 with Cholesky order from gCRD to gNDVO. The inverse relation between cash and non-cash money is not the relation we suppose: the influence of gRD on gNDVO that the VAR model with the lag order of 1 identified was probably reflect the fact that NDVO and CRD moved in the directions opposite to each other in the 1980s (see Chart 3).

From discussion on the balance method of cash money management, the Soviet authority probably used the variables that appeared in the balance of monetary income and some other variables such as nominal and real net material product to forecast demand for cash money. Although the available data were annual data, the time scope of the Soviet monetary management might be shorter than one year. We assume two cases where the Soviet authority used information in the previous period and in the same period: this may contribute to coping with the shorter time scope of the Soviet authority.

Table 5 showed that it was difficult to predict changes in demand for cash money using the variables in the current and previous periods. It was probable that the Soviet authority intended to control money circulation using the targets related to the volume or the growth rate of cash money supply; it, however, did not seem very meaningful if demand for money was not predictable. 4.3 Money supply and real economy The purpose of the analysis in this sub-section is to statistically examine if any relation existed between money supply and real economy; the policy operability of the variables and the possible structural relations between the variables which the Soviet monetary management assumed were not considered. 26/57\n4.3.1 Money-Income-Real Production VAR model We estimate a VAR model including cash money in circulation (gNDVO), household monetary income (gDD), and real net material product (RNMP) as the explanatory variables. The results of the analyses in Sub-section 4.2 suggested that it would little improve the VAR model to include more explanatory variables. It was worth to consider to include price index, PLEV, as an explanatory variable or to deflate NDVO and DD by PLEV; this settings, however, were not adopted. It was doubtful if PLEV could be a proxy for consumer price index because of the methodology to calculate PLEV. We can assume that DD includes the price factor. Consumer sales (CS), which was the absorption factor of cash money, was not included in the explanatory variables. This is firstly because the analysis in the subsection 4.2 showed that CS little influenced cash money circulation and DD and NDVO can approximate the absorption of cash money (DD - NDVO = CS). It would be desirable to include bank loan (CRD) in the VAR model to represent the relation between money and real economy; CRD was, however, excluded. The analysis in Sub-section 4.1 showed the division between cash and non-cash flows was effective. Moreover, the CRD series are short: the accuracy of the estimation is reduced if we include CRD in the VAR model. The figures of gNDVO for 1947, 1948, 1960, and 1961 were excluded as they were in Sub-section 4.2.

Cholesky ordering was set as from gRNMP, to gDD, and to NDVO, considering the possible influence path from money to real production. Table 6 supported the results of Granger causality test: a shock in gNDVO reduced gRNMP only in the model with the lag order of 3 (Lag3NT)'*. On the other hand, a shock in gRNMP reduced both gDD and gNDVO in all cases. This inverse influences from gNDVO to gRNMP in the model with the lag order of 3 and form gRNMP to gNDVO in all models were not regarded as an usual relation between money and real production. From the analysis of the VAR models, we found that money supply did not influence real production except for the model with the lag order of 3. The influence from money to real production in the model with the lag order of 3 was a relation which an increase (decrease) in money supply leads to a decrease (increase) in real production. We found that real production influenced money supply in all models; this relation was again an inverse relation. The inverse relation between money supply and real production probably reflects the fact that deterioration in real economy and increase in money supply occurred at the same time during the inflation in the periods of the early 1930s, the war, and Perestroika. 4.3.2 Money - Income - Real Production VEC model DD, RNMP, and NDVO are difference stationary; we need, therefore, to 'S Influences of changes in Cholesky order were negligible in this case.

Both trace statistic and max eigenvalue statistic for Cases (1) to (3) showed the existence of one co-integration vector at the 5% significance level, while both statistics for Case (4) rejected existence of co-integration vector at the significance 5% level. Because the VEC models used the level variables, introduction of a dummy variable (D2346) that was | in the years from 1923 through to 1946 and 0 in the other years was considered to identify the periods before and after the 1947 monetary reform. For the model with the lag order of 1, D2346 was significant at the 5% level in the gRNMP equation and not significant in the other equations; we, therefore, estimated the models of the lag order of 1 both with D2346 and without D2346. For the models with the lag orders of 2 and 3, D2346 was not significant at 5% level in all equations. Chart 6 shows the results of Granger causality test on the estimated VEC models.

RNMP also influenced NDVO inversely: an increase (decrease) in real production caused a decrease (increase) in cash money. Note that the results showed the impulse responses between the level variables in the VEC models. There were only a few years when the level of NDVO or RNMP actually decreased (see Appendix Table, Appendix Chart 1, and Appendix Chart 2). The inverse relation between NDVO and RNMP probably reflected that real production decreased during the inflation periods before the 1947 monetary reform. The Perestroika period was not the case, because the levels of NDVO and RNMP were not reduced during the Perestroika period, so far as the official statistics reported. 29/57 The error correction terms in the VEC models can be interpreted as the long term relations between the level variables of NDVO, DD, and RNMP: the estimated coefficient of the error correction term indicates the adjustment coefficient, that 1s the ratio of adjustment within a period to the deviation from the long-term relation. Table 8(A) indicates the adjustments coefficients of the VEC models. An adjustment coefficient should be within the rage of -1 to 0, 1f a VEC model actually represent an error correction behavior.

The VEC models, nevertheless, statistically reflected the relations between the variables. The periods when cash money in circulation (NDVO) moved opposite to real net material product (RNMP) were the Industrialization period and the war-time inflation period only: increases in money and deterioration in real production indeed occurred at the same time in these periods. In the other periods, influences between cash 30/57 money and real production were probably weak in both directions, if they existed. Table 11 shows the results of the variance decomposition of the VEC models: change in NDVO accounted for a few percentage of a change in RNMP in all model settings.

{"text": "Discussion We discuss economic meaning of the results of the quantitative analysis and the future direction of research in this section. We analyzed the Soviet monetary management historically and institutionally and confirmed that the Soviet authority basically pursued for monetary stability. The Soviet authority seemed to intend to manage money circulation with some volume target of cash money supply. How to establish the target and how to achieve the target were, however, not clear: the Soviet authority seemed to rely on the limit on bank notes issue and securing it by control on wage payments and consumer sales, assuming that the institutional division between the cash and non-cash money flows were effective. Soviet literature did not present the method and the procedure to decide the issue limit. Moreover, Soviet literature fell silent about policy instruments to manage excessive money, although actual money supply seemed to inevitably differ from expected money supply. Being based on the results of the historical and institutional analysis, we quantitatively analyzed the effectiveness of the division of cash and non-cash money flows which was the cornerstone of the Soviet monetary management. This is followed by the analysis of the predictability of demand for cash money. Unless demand for cash money was more or less predictable, limiting supply of cash money was not very meaningful. Finally, we statistically examined how cash money supply related to real economy. The results of the quantitative analyses showed the following: First, the division of cash and non-cash money flows was effective. Second, it was difficult to predict demand for cash money from information in the previous and the current periods. 31/57 It was doubtful that the Soviet monetary management, which was based on the limit of banknote issue, functioned effectively. Indeed, the actual changes in cash money supply did not seem to follow simple rules of cash money supply, although some obscure upper limit of cash money supply seemed to exist. Third, cash money supply and real production influenced not strongly each other. The analysis suggested that cash money supply inversely influenced real production; this inverse relation was probably a statistical reflection of the inverse relation between money and real production during the inflations in the Industrialization, the war, and the Perestroika periods.", "tokens": 372, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "The results of our study seems consistent with Gorssman's theory on the Soviet money (Grossman, 1963; Grossman, 1966) and the recent results of micro economic analysis using Soviet archives by Gregory and others (Grgory, 2001: Gregory, 2004, Gregory and Harrison, 2005). The Soviet monetary management was probably far less functional than one might imagine. The monetary management seemed to depend solely on control of wage payments; the effectively of limiting banknote issue seemed highly doubtful. It was more or less true that wage payments was only the pathway to supply cash money because the institutional division of cash and non-cash money flows probably worked. The control of wage payments set a vague ceiling on cash money supply; it was, however, unpredictable where money supply fell around the ceiling. None could foresee how the production plan of consumer goods would be achieved, how consumers reacted to consumer goods offered, how much it was allowed to pay wage over the planned limit, how many and to what degree bad performed enterprises were bailed out, and so on. These were determined as a result of numerous and uncoordinated administrative and political decisions. This is reflected by our finding that the level of cash money showed a strong correlation with the other level variables and changes in cash money fell in a certain range, while demand for cash money was unpredictable. We can conclude that it is not appropriate to explain the role of money in the Soviet administrative command economy with either passive or active money concept. Rather, the fundamental problem of the Soviet monetary management was that the role of money could not be explained either passive or active money concept (see Grossman, 1966, p.235). Money mattered in the Soviet economy (see Gregory, pp. 218-222); this was the very reason why the Soviet authority pursued for monetary stability. What they 32/57\ncould not do was to construct an effective institution of monetary management. It was true that influence of money on resource allocation was weak in the Soviet economy as our quantitative analysis showed; the monetary disequilibria caused by defects of material plans, nevertheless, caused shortage, queuing, excess hoard of money, rapid increase in deposits, expansion of black markets, and circulation of money surrogate including hard currencies. It was ironical that material planning was partially successful to maintain the value of ruble: Ruble's having its value meant that ruble had power to move economic resources. On the other hand, under the Soviet command administrative economy where price index, interest rates, and foreign exchange rate were institutionally eliminated, it was difficult to detect monetary disequilibria and to understand their economic meanings: the Soviet institutional settings also deprived the monetary authority the monetary policy instruments. Changes in political and administrative decision and material planning were necessary to eliminate monetary disequilibria. There did not seem to exist an automatic and economic mechanism to adjust monetary disequilibria; non-existence of systematic relation between money and real production that our research showed probably reflected this situation. If monetary disequilibrium was serious, then political and administrative measures to eliminate the disequilibrium might be also serious. Ignoring the risk of political and social unrests, it was easy to eliminate monetary disequilibrium: through raising consumer prices, decreasing wages, increasing tax, or confiscating financial assets as it was done in the 1947 monetary reform. When none expected that vigorous measures lead to a recovery from an economic disequilibrium and to sustainable economic development, it was almost impossible to exert the measures. The result of this research made it difficult to consider the Soviet administrative command economy as a complete economic system that could substitute the market economy system: the problem of monetary management seemed to be left unsolved in the Soviet system. We can suppose that the Soviet system did not intend to solve the problem from the beginning. If it 1s true, the question should be asked 1s this: why such Soviet system existed until 1990 and was not collapsed before then? The Soviet system had still many political, social and economic mysteries to be cleared. The availability of data limited severely our analysis: the important data including the balance of payments, the balance sheets of the banks, the financial flows\n33/57 between the state budget and the banking system, the disbursement and repayment of bank loans may sleep in the Soviet archives. If data on expectations and prospects of the Soviet authority were available, we can deepen our analysis greatly and construct more sophisticated models. The more data become available, the further researches on the economic, political, and social aspects of the Soviet monetary management advance. 34/57 Reference Alkhimov, V. S., ed.

Economic Crises and the European Revolutions of 1848 Abstract Recent historical research tends to view the 1848 revolution in Europe as caused by a surge of new liberal ideas and by long-term socioeconomic problems. However, many contemporary observers interpreted much of what was going on as a consequence of the serious shortfall in food supply that had shaken large parts of the continent in 1845-47, and the subsequent economic slump, i.e. short-term causes. Applying standard quantitative methods to a dataset of 27 European countries, we show that it was mainly economic misery and the fear thereof that triggered the European revolutions of 1847/48. JEL: N13 Keywords: revolution, economic crisis, political institutions, hunger, grain prices, industrial production a CES, University of Munich, and CESifo b University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart. Corresponding author: Helge Berger, CES, Schackstrasse 4, 80539 Munich, Germany, e-mail: h.berger@ces.vwl.uni- muenchen.de Introduction\nIn the 1990s, the acceleration of economic and political integration in Western Europe and the democratization of Eastern Europe led to an increasing interest in the turbulent years of 1848/49, when large parts of the continent experienced a striving for political participation and self-determination.! The recent anniversary year gave rise to a wealth of literature, especially in countries for which the revolution of 1848 meant a first step towards more democratic political institutions, for instance in countries such as Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Romania. Many of these studies reflect the trend in historiography from social history to cultural history. Whereas in the 1970s and 1980s long-term and short-term socioeconomic determinants played a pivotal role in explaining the 1848 revolutions, short-term economic factors tend to be marginalized in recent publications. To be sure, even after the culturalistic turn most historians concede that long-term structural socioeconomic problems contributed to rising popular discontent, but surprisingly few authors stress the importance of the deep economic crisis that immediately preceded the revolutionary events. Instead, many attribute much of the revolutionary activity to the spread of liberal and democratic ideas among Europeans. This is true for a number of monographs, which mention short-run economic factors not at all or only in passing, as well as for many edited volumes, which often do not contain a single paper on the economic crisis preceding the events of 1848.2 To some extent | See, e.g., Kaelble, \"Viele nationale Revolutionen\". 2 We systematically checked monographs and paper collections covering the 1848 revolution on a national level in English, German, and Latin languages published since the mid 1990s for discussions of short-term socioeconomic developments such as the increase of food prices 1845-47 or the economic downturn 1846-48 preceding the 1848 turmoils. Hobelt, 1848, and 2\nthis is also true for an alternative view that points towards the inflexible and increasingly outdated political institutions of the time, which were ill suited to cope with the societal problems of early industrialization. Issues at stake were the material deprivation of large parts of the rural population (pauperism) and state intervention in individual affairs, for instance, through the military draft system and discretionary taxation. Bruckmiiller and Hausler, 1848, who analyze the revolution in Austria, do not discuss economic factors at all. Neither do Schroeder, Transformation, or Broers, Europe, or the contributions on Hungary in Fischer, Ungarische Revolution. In the account of Judson, Wien, of the revolution in Austria socioeconomic factors are rarely mentioned. For Switzerland, the contributions in Hildbrand and Tanner, Zeichen, do not refer to economic factors. Some of the work on Switzerland collected in Ernst, Tanner, and Weishaupt, Revolution, does mention economic factors, but economic factors are not found causal for the revolution. Even in the abundant German anniversary literature the economic crisis is almost totally neglected. See Dipper and Speck, 1848, Dowe, Haupt, and Langewiesche, Europa 1848, Gall, 1848, Hardtwig, Revolution, Jansen and Mergel, Revolution, Lill, Revolution, Mommsen, Ungewollte Revolution, Rill, 1848, Timmermann, 1848, and Langewiesche, Revolutionen. Notable exceptions are Sperber, European Revolutions, Hahn, \"Soziodkonomische Ordnung\", Hein, Revolution, Leveque, Ebranlement, and Stiirmer, Crise. In contrast, earlier accounts of the 1848 revolutions analyzed long and short-term socioeconomic factors in great detail, see, e.g., Stearns, Revolutions, pp. 11-35, Charles, Louise, and Richard Tilly, Rebellious Century, Siemann, Deutsche Revolution, Pinkney, Decisive Years, Wehler, Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, pp. 681f., and Price, Revolutions, pp. 7, 24-26. 3 For an overview, see Sperber, European Revolutions, pp. 47-49. 3 However, while ideas and institutions undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of the necessary preconditions for the European revolutions of 1848, they fail to explain the timing, simultaneity, or regional distribution of the events. Here a more economic perspective might be helpful. Many contemporary observers interpreted much of what was going on as a direct consequence of the serious shortfall in basic food supplies that had shaken the continent in 1845-47 and triggered famine and hunger riots throughout Europe, especially in Ireland, Flanders, and Silesia.* A radical variant of this argument interprets the revolutions of 1848 in the broader context of class conflicts a view championed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and later refined by Jiirgen Kuczynski. However, this materialistic view is by no means confined to Marxist historiography. Another early example is Ernst Engel, the well-known nineteenth-century Prussian statistician, who maintained that the economic crisis was what triggered the bomb in many parts of Europe. This strong emphasis on economic factors is also reflected in one strand of the Anglo-Saxon literature, ranging from W.W. Rostow, Eric Hobsbawm, and George Rude to Charles, Louise, and Richard Tilly. It is supported by a number of empirical studies of social disorder in the 1840s, which stress the importance of economic motives. For France, Ernest Labrousse explicitly linked the revolutions of 1789, + Sigmann, 1848, pp. 183-85. > Kuczynski, \"Wirtschaftliche und soziale Voraussetzungen.\" 6 Engel, \"Getreidepreise,\" p. 251 (our translation).

However, the disillusion with empirical social history and the subsequent ascendancy of cultural history has led to a curious neglect of the short-term economic crises of 1845-48. By contrast, our findings suggest that it is precisely the analysis of the pre-revolutionary economic crises that is most helpful in explaining the timing, simultaneity, and regional distribution of the European turmoil of 1848. In other words, even though ideas and institutions undoubtedly shaped the events of the late 1840s, it was economic misery and the fear thereof that triggered the European revolutions. This resurrection of the economic view of the 1848 revolutions is based on the high correlation between the geographic distribution of economic distress and political turbulence across Europe. In fact, after identifying the countries that were hit by a significant food supply shock in 1845-47 and discussing evidence of a propagation mechanism that prolonged the crisis well into 1848, we find that there is an almost perfect geographical match between economic crises and revolutionary activities throughout Europe. We also show that institutions, namely the existence or absence of a repressive political regime, while adding little to the explanation of the occurrence of revolutionary activity, had a significant influence on the form such activity took. Revolutions tended to be more violent if the regime was repressive. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 investigates the size and significance of the grain price shock which hit most European countries in the second half of the 1840s. To grasp the extent to which these shocks were indeed unexpected, we estimate the forecast errors of standard adaptive expectations models for a dataset encompassing wheat prices for 27 countries between 1820 and 1850. It turns out that most European countries experienced a Voraussetzungen\", idem, Wirtschaftskrise, and Gailus, StraBe. ? Labrousse, \"1848.\" severe price shock in 1847. Section 3 explores the propagation mechanism that extended the crisis well into 1848. We find evidence that falling consumption and investment demand transformed the negative supply shock in the agricultural sector into a lagged demand shock in manufacturing. Section 4 constructs the last building block of our argument by drawing a connection between political activity and its possible economic causes. Section 5 concludes. The Supply Shock in the Agricultural Sector, 1845-47 The resurrection of the economic view of the 1848 revolutions relies heavily on the occurrence of a pre-revolutionary economic crisis across Europe. But what defines an economic crisis? What sort of crisis will trigger political activity by individuals? And which individuals? A possible starting point is the concept of a revolution. With respect to the revolutions of 1848, two characteristics stand out among the many definitions available: (1) the use of violence, or the credible threat of using it as a means to change the political system, and (11) collective action, that is, active involvement of the crowd in that attempted political change.! In the following, we will define a revolution either as widespread violence targeted at changing the political system or as immediate and substantial constitutional reform implemented to prevent imminent collective action or violence to that end. The potential or actual involvement of a large number of individuals has important consequences for our\n!0 Kimmel, Revolution, pp. 4-7, and Goldstone, Revolution, pp. 7-12. We follow the broader definitions of Kimmel which do not require that a revolution necessarily be successful. This broad definition is similar to the notion of revolution in Ch. Tilly, \"Revolutions,\" pp. 519-24 and what he defined later as a revolutionary situation, Ch. Tilly, European Revolutions, p. 10. question here. Obviously, our understanding of why a revolution did or did not take place should not be based solely on an analysis of elites and their economic situation. While lawyers, publishers, journalists, doctors, and academics were undoubtedly important protagonists during the 1848 upheavals across Europe, they would not have been able to act revolutionarily on their own. It was the lower classes who provided the muscle. As a consequence, our focus shifts from the well-known revolutionary protagonists to the average man or woman, especially in the capitals, where revolutionary activities were most pronounced.!! A causal nexus between the economic situation of the ordinary population and possible participation in revolutionary activities requires there to have been a severe popular fear of a deteriorating socioeconomic situation. Siegenthaler has explained why and how economic discontent beyond a certain threshold tends to trigger political action.!* Under the conditions of the restoration, 1.e. the absence of effective democratic institutions, this was likely to take the form of revolutionary activity in the above defined sense. The question is how to measure both discontent and threshold. Clearly, the economic view suggests a microeconomic approach. Households feel the ups and downs of macroeconomic activity through changes in their real budgets. While this is as true today as it was during the first half of the nineteenth century, the channels through which an economic crisis would influence the family budget were different then. On the expenditure side, lower-class households around 1850 still spent between two thirds and three quarters of their incomes on nourishment.!> The bulk of the food purchased consisted of grain products\n11 Labrousse, \"1848,\" p. 77.", "tokens": 878, "label": "heavy"}

This sensitivity was greater the smaller the overall size of the budget, as low- income households tend to allocate even larger portions of their budgets to food-related expenditures (Engels Law).!* In addition, the ability of households to avoid any squeeze on their budgets by substituting between different types of grain was limited. For the period 1816-50, the literature on Prussia reports correlation coefficients of 0.87 for wheat and rye prices and 0.67 for wheat and potato prices.! This high integration of local grain markets in this period is illustrated by Figure 1. It plots bimonthly percentage changes in wheat prices over the previous year against a similar series for rye prices between 1820 and 1850 for the Prussian district of Arnsberg.

On the other hand, there is hardly any reliable information on effective working hours or un(der)employment, which makes it almost impossible to compute a meaningful income series.! A feasible solution for non-agricultural employment is to turn to Okuns Law and try to draw inferences about employment from the overall level of industrial activity.!8 We have good reason to believe that this law was also valid for the nineteenth century (in fact, more so than today), and data on industrial production, at least on a sectoral level, are available for a number of countries. Summing up, it seems possible to put together a sufficiently accurate picture of the economic well-being of households prior to the political turmoil which shook Europe around 1848. Figure 2 takes a first step. It displays time series for grain prices for four large European economies. With the exceptions of Oldenburg and Russia (both rye prices), all 27 series are wheat prices.

Whereas the wheat price patterns of France and Prussia look very similar, the English and especially the Swedish experience look different. The English series shows the impact of the easing of the Corn Laws in 1842 as well as their abolition in 1846. Notwithstanding these and other idiosyncrasies, however, the series for France, Prussia, and England appear to share a number of regularities. One of them is the price increase and thus, presumably, a decrease in living standards for the majority of the population during the 1845-47 period. This should not come as a surprise. There is evidence of a convergence of European grain markets by this time due to less costly land and sea transportation.2! Figure 3 further illustrates the phenomenon by comparing the coefficient of variation between a set of five continental European regions and Prussia since the early 1820s.

Starting at levels four times larger, by the 1840s the regions had reached roughly comparable levels of market integration. But there are also discrepancies in the time paths portrayed in Figure 2 above. While in France and Prussia the years 1845-47 are marked by a dramatic increase in grain prices, the price movements in England and Sweden in these years do not stand out as particularly irregular. This discrepancy may be important. Consider a household that, based on past experience, takes the precautions necessary to insure itself against regular and thus in principle foreseeable swings in the cost of living. Clearly, as long as a price increase stays within the expected range, we would not expect an extraordinary (or political) reaction. If, however, an exceptional price shock severely and unexpectedly diminished the real budget of a large part of the population, such a backlash seems much more likely. The argument lends itself to a more formal exposition.

Figure 4 presents the computed forecast errors and the respective 2-standard-error bands for the four countries already selected for Figure 2. Figure 4 about here The interpretation of the results is fairly easy. If at any point in time the graph deviates positively (or negatively) from zero, the actual price level of this period exceeded (or fell short of) the (assumed) expectations of households. If a deviation is larger than two times the standard errors of the model used to compute the forecast, we observe a significant shock. It turns out that the results are very much in line with the discussion of the time series displayed earlier in Figure 2. While both France and Prussia feature a significant positive price shock in 1846-47 (as well as a corresponding negative shock as prices returned to normal in 1848), England and Sweden do not. The reason for this is that even though both countries experienced higher prices prior to 1848, these increases stayed within the confines of the normal ups and downs of the cost of living. This is obvious in the case of Sweden, but it 1s also true for England. In England, it is only the fall in prices after the good harvest of 1847 25 Based on standard ADF tests. The price series for Baden, Hesse, Saxony, Sweden, and Wurttemberg are only stationary around a trend. However, recalculating the AR models with difference-filtered data or introducing a trend into the estimated model does not change the results. The same is true for the Finnish series. Only Hesse remains a borderline case. The complete data set (grain prices as well as computed forecast errors) for the sample is available on request. 13 that is extraordinary enough to qualify as a shock relative to expectations albeit a positive one.? Before we move on, a brief discussion of the threshold that divides price movements into normal ups and downs and shocks is called for. Our 2-standard-error criterion is purely statistical, i.e., it builds on the conventional notion of statistical significance. From a strictly historical perspective this might seem somewhat arbitrary.", "tokens": 395, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "However, the statistical criterion does not seem an unreasonable approximation of any real-world threshold and might very well be viewed as a benchmark for a more historical rule of thumb. For instance, simply focusing on the number of pre-revolutionary years in which grain prices were above their average value leads to a very similar profile of shocks across countries (see Table 3, col. (111) below). Such a rule does, however, ignore the role price expectations might have played for the accumulation of buffer stocks and, ultimately, for the impact the agrarian crisis had on households. Also note that the 2-standard-error criterion of the forecast model leads to very robust results. Any other threshold value in an interval of +0.18 around 2 produces the very same distribution of pre-1848 shocks among the countries in our sample. We will return to this issue in Section 3. From Figure 4 and from similar figures for the other 23 countries in our sample? it follows that a number of European countries did indeed suffer a significant positive shock to their cost of living prior to the 1848 revolution. It is tempting to jump ahead and compare the regional distribution of these findings with the occurrence of political turbulence across the area under investigation. But there is the problem of timing. Even though there is a certain amount of variance in the point in time at which the grain crisis hit the economies in our data 26 Jreland (for which we do not have comparable data) was a very different case.

Thus, what consumers experienced in both countries was far more than a short blip, instead, 1t was a seemingly incessant price increase for two and a half years. Moreover, although prices were falling, they were still somewhat higher in late 1847 and early 1848 than on average during the previous grain price cycle of 1838-45.2? However, when political unrest started to spread across Europe in early 1848, the situation as measured by the cost of living had definitely improved in both countries. Even in Berlin, where prices were on the rise again later in the year, the surprisingly good harvests in the autumn of 1847 helped household expenditures to get back to their average levels during the first half of 1848. To some extent the time lag between the peak of the food price crisis and the political unrest is not totally unexpected.

But there is an additional economic link between the two events. Propagation of the Crisis to the Industrial Sector , 1847/48\nIn fact, one of the reasons why so many contemporary observers such as, for instance, the economist Wilhelm Roscher, insisted on a close connection between economic crisis and political unrest was the lagged propagation of the agricultural crisis into other sectors of the economy.?! Most economies in mid-nineteenth-century Europe were still greatly influenced by fluctuations in agriculture. With a majority of households earning close to the subsistence level, price increases in the basic food sector translated into lower demand for all other goods and, thus, for manufacturers.5* This propagation probably took place with a time lag, as some households could turn to their savings to smooth consumption. However, it seems plausible to presume that eventually lower household demand (the consumption channel) and, in addition, low investment demand (the investment channel) would turn an agricultural crisis such as the pre-1848 grain price shock into a crisis in the manufacturing sector as well. 30 Stearns, Revolutions, p.", "tokens": 239, "label": "medium"}

Several forces possibly had an impact on investment financing conditions via credit demand and credit supply. During a negative food supply shock, purchasing power is shifted from (net) food consumers to (net) food producers. As nutritional status declines toward or even falls below the subsistence level, demand becomes price-inelastic. This was the case in 1845-47, when net food consumers, especially urban lower and middle classes, were forced to reduce their savings.?> While their savings fell, savings by net food producer presumably increased. But since food producers will have spent at least some of their extra profits on extra purchases of other goods, the overall effect of the price increase on credit demand must have been positive. By contrast, credit supply contracted under the rules of specie standard. England, for instance, for which we have several accounts, experienced a gold drain because her balance of trade turned negative, thus inducing gold outflows which led to a contraction of domestic money supply.** A third factor which also resulted in a tightening of the credit market was misspeculation. When expectations concerning the coming harvest switched from gloomy to optimistic and massive corn imports from Russia and the United States were reaching the markets, prices plummeted in mid-1847 and many traders were in desperate need of credit. This further increased interest rates increased all over Europe.*> In fact, the available data underestimates 33, See, for instance, Obermann, \"Wirtschafts- und sozialpolitische Aspekte,\" for evidence on dissaving in Prussian lower- and middle-class households. 34 Described in detail by Boot, Commercial Crisis, ch. VI. See also Ward-Perkins, \"Commercial Crisis.\" 35 See for monthly London market and bank rates Ward-Perkins, \"Commercial Crisis,\" p. 94.

{"text": "While most of the available European interest rate series show a local maximum in 1847, the impact of tighter financial conditions was felt as early as the second half of 1846 and, due to the planning lags involved in investment demand, well into 1848. Indeed statistical evidence seems to suggests a negative impact of lagged interest rates on the manufacturing sector. 3/ While such exercises are seriously hampered by the quality of the interest rate data (see above), they seem to be in line with the available anecdotal evidence. For instance, we know that numerous firms failed between the second half of 1846 and the end of 1848, especially in the textile sector, and that contemporaries saw lack of credit as one of the main factors behind this. The visible slowdown in railway track investment in France, Germany, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, England also points in that direction.

By contrast, most French railways had been nationalized and it was lack of public funds due to the food crisis which made the government cancel railway investment programs. In both countries, this affected the metals and mining sectors seriously from early/mid-1847 onwards through 1848. In conclusion, it would seem that the deterioration of financing conditions in the wake of the agrarian crisis 1845-47 had a sizable lagged real effect on firm failures and investment behavior that transmitted the crisis across sectors and into the critical year of 1848. Turning from the investment to the consumption channel, we can apply a somewhat more direct test for the existence of a propagation mechanism. Although there are no reliable data on household demand for manufactured goods, it seem reasonable to rely on grain prices as a proxy for the changes in household demand. The question to be addressed is whether there 1s evidence for a lagged propagation of the grain crisis into manufacturing and, following Okuns Law, possibly to employment. As a first step, we subject the data at hand to a standard Granger causality test. In a nutshell, the test asks how much of the growth path of, say, French manufacturing output can be explained by lagged values of French grain prices and vice versa.*9 In both cases the possible determinants are added to an AR model of the endogenous 39 See Labrousse, \"1848,\" idem, \"Panoramas\", and Spree and Bergmann, \"Konjunkturelle Entwicklung,\" pp. 314-21. The growth of the German rail-network did not accelerate again before the 1850s.

For instance, the rejection of the null hypothesis of no causality in the case of lagged grain prices influencing production would suggest that the former series precedes the latter and helps in forecasting it.

The period under consideration is again 1820-50. Table 1 about here The main message of Table 1 is that grain prices are indeed Granger causal for manufacturing in some countries, and the other way around in no single country. The results for Austria and the Netherlands are somewhat weak, but still suggestive. The results for England fall in the same category, but here we should not be surprised given Englands leading role in the process of industrialization. In general, the evidence clearly suggests that changes in grain prices preceded changes in the growth rate of non-agricultural activity. The results lend credibility to the claim that the economic crisis of 1845-47, initiated by bad harvests, extended into 1848 by triggering a crisis in the manufacturing sector. Or did it? After all, the existence of a Granger causal relationship between grain prices and manufacturing does not necessarily imply that a significant shock (in the sense defined above) to the former series also causes a significant shock to the latter. In order to see whether there are significant shocks in the available production data following significant shocks in grain prices, we again make use of the method established in Section 2. Figure 6 presents forecast errors from a model similar to equation (2) for the data used in Table 1. Again, we set the lag of the AR part uniformly to n = 5 across all countries even 20 though some of the data series are rather short: the French, Prussian, and Habsburg series start only in 1820, 1828, and 1830, respectively. The remaining series, however, run from 1815- 50.4! Figure 6 about here\nAustria, France, Hungary, and Prussia show a significant negative shock to output growth in manufacturing in 1848, whereas England and Sweden, which were also spared a shock in grain prices, do not. The borderline case is the Netherlands, which experienced a grain price shock but not a manufacturing shock. Thus, except for that case, we find that all countries included in the manufacturing dataset that were hit (or not hit) by a significant positive shock in grain prices 1846-47 also found themselves suffering (or exempt) from a significant negative industrial production shock in 1848.42 Even though Figure 6 adds considerably to the evidence produced by the Granger tests discussed above, there are still reasons why the propagation argument might not yet be convincing. First, the results concerning production could themselves be influenced by the revolutionary activity of 1848. After all, workers protesting in the streets are not at their 41 All series are stationary according to standard ADF tests. In the case of The Netherlands the series is stationary around a trend. The results are robust with regard to changes in the lag length of the AR model used to compute the forecasts and standard errors. 42 Again the statistical rule identifying shocks is quite robust.

Where significant, interest rates had a negative impact on output growth. The results with regard to grain prices and the revolution dummy were similar to the results presented in Table 2. Additional results available on request. 22 Let us first consider columns (1) without the revolution dummy. From what has been said about the consumption channel which may have linked the agricultural sector with manufacturing, we should expect the grain price coefficients to be negative and significant. Indeed the sign of the impact of grain prices is as anticipated in all cases, and lacks statistical significance at conventional levels only in the cases of England, the industrial leader, and the Netherlands. Given that some of the time series are rather short, the performance of the consumption channel is quite robust with regard to the introduction of the REV dummy (columns (11)). The dummy variable has at least a marginally significant negative impact for France, Hungary, and Prussia, while the impact on the Swedish and English series is positive. Austria shows a non- significant negative sign for REV. But while the revolution played some role in shaping manufacturing activity, an important part of the explanation of the slump in production in 1848 obviously still derives from lagged grain prices. The negative sign of the variable remains unchanged across countries and, with the exception of Austria and Hungary, at least marginally significant. In the case of England the grain price variable even becomes significant at the five percent level after the introduction of 1848 dummy variable. The results for the Dutch data remain unchanged.**\nWhat was the quantitative impact of the 1847 grain crisis on manufacturing? Take, for instance, Prussia and France, which display a significant price variable in both columns. Prices in Prussia (France) increased by 27.12 (37.85) grams fine silver from 1846 to 1847. Based on the estimated 6 coefficients in Table 2, column (i1), this translated into a decrease in 1848 manufacturing levels of about 7.86 (3.03) percentage points or about 32.67 (23.03) per 44 Note that to the extent that the revolution is in fact endogenous to the economic crisis we should rely on a model excluding the 1848 dummy. 23 cent of the actual 1848 decline in manufacturing. Based on column (1) the decline explained by the grain crisis 1s even larger (47.31 and 46.06 per cent, respectively). In England, the negative impact of the grain price rise on growth in the manufacturing sector remained in the two-percentage-point range (and too low to force an overall decline in real activity). We can conclude that the quantitative impact of the grain crisis on the industrial sector was considerable in France, Prussia, and the Habsburg countries, but not in more highly industrialized England. Crisis and Revolution Section 2 established the existence of a regional pattern of significant shocks to grain prices and, thus, to the cost of living in a number of European countries between 1845 and 1847. Section 3 then linked the grain crisis to the manufacturing sector, helping to explain the propagation of the initial shock into 1848.

For these countries we were not able to find compatible grain price data extending back to the 1820s. Table 3 about here The data in the first five columns refer to the grain prices in these countries. Column (1) reports the average wheat or rye prices 1838-45, and column (11) the maximum price between 1845 and 1848. Column (iu) reports for how many of the years 1845-47 the price was higher than the average price 1838-45. In column (iv) the maximum price forecast error of the years 1845 to 1848 is divided by the corresponding standard error. Whether the deviation of the actual from the forecasted price between 1845 and 1848 was a shock in the sense defined above (deviation larger than +2 standard errors), is indicated in column (v). Columns (vi) to (vill) repeat the shock analysis for those countries for which we have production data. If the deviation between actual and forecasted industrial growth is less than 2 standard errors, we speak of a production shock in column (viii). The next step is to confront these data with the political data in the last two columns. Column (ix) indicates whether or not the political atmosphere in early 1848 was repressive, and column (x) indicates whether or not a country experienced a revolution. For countries with immediate and substantial constitutional changes but no widespread violence, the yes is in parentheses. Now we are able to give an answer to the question of whether the European revolutions of 1848 were caused or at least strongly influenced by short-term economic factors. Comparing 26 columns (viii) and (x) we find that, with the exception of the Netherlands, in those countries which experienced a negative industrial production shock, there was a revolution as well. By contrast, in England and Sweden there was neither an industrial production shock nor a revolution. It is reassuring that, very much in line with the analysis in the preceding section, the occurrence and absence of shocks in food prices and manufacturing are highly correlated. However, evidence for just seven countries may not be totally persuasive. Therefore, in a second step, we make fuller use of our data set. To do this, we compare columns (v) and (viii) which register the occurrence of shocks in grain prices and manufacturing. With the exception of the Netherlands, we find that only countries with a price shock in 1845-48 experienced a manufacturing shock in 1848, and vice versa. The finding adds further weight to the hypothesis explored in Section 3 that a propagation mechanism existed which extended the shock waves of the agrarian crisis into 1848. Consequently, we can compare the earlier price shocks in column (v) directly with the political data for 1848 in column (x) even for those countries for which we do not have production data. The result is surprisingly clear-cut. There is a nearly perfect regional match between the existence of a grain price shock and a revolution: among the 21 states which experienced revolutionary turmoil, 20 had been hit by a grain price shock between 1845 and 1847. Only Denmark is an outlier. By contrast, of the six countries without a revolution, only one, Norway, showed signs of a price shock in the grain market.*8\n48 These results are in line with those of Goldstone, Revolution, pp. 343-48, who finds a high geographical correlation between population pressure and state crises in Europe between 1750 and 1850. Note, however, that our results are immune to the criticism that the explanatory variable (in our case the price shocks) is endogenous. 27 The outcome is also remarkably robust with regard to the underlying definition of economic shocks. As pointed out earlier, the 2-standard-error threshold is primarily a statistical rule of thumb. However, a comparison of columns (iv) and (x) reveals that indeed any threshold value between 1.82 and 2.18 would have resulted in the same proportion of 25 out of 27 countries fitting the economic view.*? The robustness of the result strongly suggests a positive correlation between the likelihood of the occurrence of a revolution and the size of the price shock in our sample. Indeed, a simple logit model exercise reveals that an increase in the pre- revolution grain price forecast error significantly increases the probability of revolutionary activity (violent and non-violent) . 49 Similarly, column (vii) shows that any threshold between 0 and -2.01 will separate countries with or without shocks in industrial production in a way that is compatible with the economic view (except for the Netherlands). 50 We estimated a ML-binary logit model for the occurrence of a revolution with a constant and the grain price forecast error in 1847 for the 27 countries or regions in our sample. The LHS variable is constructed as a dummy that takes the value 1 when column (x) in Table 3 shows either a yes or a (yes) and O otherwise. The estimated coefficient for the grain price forecast error 1s 1.83 with a s.e. of 0.57 (significant at the 4 percent level). This translates into an increase in the probability of a revolution for a one-unit increase in the 1847 forecast error from zero of about 21 percentage points. A one-unit increase from a forecast error level of one (two) increases the probability of a revolution by about 46 (23) percentage points. McFadden- R is 0.18. The standard deviation of the 1847 forecast errors is 0.88. Using the grain price forecast error as listed in Table 3, which for some countries deviates from the 1847 figure, does not change these results. Details available on request. 28 Also note that less sophisticated measures of the depth of the agrarian crisis lead to comparable findings. For instance, a comparison of columns (111) and (x) shows that the number of years in the period 1845-47 in which a country suffered from relatively high grain prices is a remarkably good indicator of the likelihood of the occurrence of revolutionary activity in 1848, too. With the exception of Denmark and Spain, politically stable countries were spared price rises of more than one year. By contrast, countries with a revolution endured a minimum of two years of above-average prices before 1848. Figure 7 about here\nIs there anything we can say about the outliers? First, regional factors might play a role. The two countries which do not fit the hypothesis that the economic crisis triggered the revolution according to the expectations-based shock criterion summarized in column (v), Denmark and Norway, as well as the Netherlands for which the production data summarized in column (viii) do not fit, are part of the North Sea area. Moreover, all cases in which countries experienced price shocks but only moderate, i.e. non-violent, revolutions are also in this region (see Figure 7). Second, institutional and political factors could be important. An obvious candidate is poor relief, which might have improved the credibility of a regime. However, we found it very difficult to gather comparable information for our sample countries. The most comprehensive comparative study in this respect is that of Lindert, who compares 10 European countries. It 1s at least noteworthy in our context that he finds that poor relief per capita in England and the Netherlands were by far higher than in the other countries.>! 5!", "tokens": 1260, "label": "heavy"}

It is interesting that, as column (ix) in Table 3 indicates, the aforementioned North Sea countries were all governed by non-repressive or liberal regimes. To pursue this idea, we employed the logit model for explaining the likelihood of overall revolutionary activity (discussed above) and a model explaining violent revolutionary activity alone. We find that, while an increase in the grain price forecast error significantly increases the likelihood of both violent and non-violent activity, the presence of a repressive political regime only affects the probability of violent activity. The violent type of revolutionary activity was significantly more likely to occur under repressive political regimes.>? Our findings thus support the idea that the character of the regime helped to shape the type of political upheaval in 1848, but that it was the economic crisis that triggered the event.

{"text": "30 most as one of numerous enabling factors. In view of the analysis put forward in the present paper, this view severely underestimates the political dynamics resulting from the extreme short-term economic fluctuations of 1845-48. A more pointed statement of this economic view would be that it was economic misery rather than ideas that caused the outbreak of revolutions in early 1848. As an initial step, we establish that there exists a propagation mechanism that links the agricultural crisis of 1845-47 with the subsequent industrial crisis in 1848. Using a number of standard time series tools, it can be shown that in the period 1820-50 there was a systematic and significant relationship between the agricultural and the industrial sectors in France, Prussia, Austria, Hungary, and Sweden, but not in England, the worlds leading and most highly industrialized economy, nor in the Netherlands. There is evidence that an increase in grain prices a good proxy for the cost of living at the time led to a decline in manufacturing activity after a certain lag. Thus, the dramatic increase in the prices of basic foods in 1845-47 must have had a strong negative effect on production and employment in the industrial sectors by 1848, the year of political unrest. This result is potentially important. It allows us to draw inferences directly about the occurrence of revolutionary activity from the rich data on European grain prices. In a second step, we demonstrate the regional pattern of the economic shocks that hit or did not hit the European countries prior to the revolutions of 1848. A shock is defined as a significant forecast error based on an adaptive expectations model. It turns out that this criterion helps to predict revolutionary activity: if a country was subject to a shock in 1845-48, it also experienced a revolution and if not, it did not. Using the much sparser available data on manufacturing we find that France, Prussia, Austria, and Hungary suffered a shock-like decline in industrial production in 1848 paralleled by significant revolutionary activity. While 31 this result is very much in line with the economic view of the 1848 events, it is based on a rather small number of observations. However, making use of the link established above between the agricultural and the manufacturing sector, we can turn to grain prices for help. In fact, the regional pattern of grain price shocks 1s very similar to that for manufacturing: if a country was subjected to a grain price shock between 1845 and 1847, then it experienced a revolution in 1848. Of 21 countries subject to a grain price shock, 20 follow this crude, but obviously powerful rule, Norway being the peaceful exception. Among the remaining six countries which did not suffer strong grain price increases, only Denmark experienced far- reaching, and in our sense revolutionary, constitutional reform. These results are very robust with regard to the underlying definition of an economic shock. We conclude that the occurrence of an economic shock in the later 1840s was an important factor in triggering the 1848 revolutions across Europe. While institutions, namely the presence or absence of a repressive political regime, add little to the explanation of the occurrence of revolutionary activity as such, we find that they did exert a significant influence on the form this activity took. The revolutions of 1848 tended to be violent in nature if the regime was repressive. We conclude that the presence of repressive regimes did not trigger events but did help to shape them.", "tokens": 584, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The same could be said about the role of ideas. The peasants and artisans of the 1840s, suffering a severe deterioration in their socioeconomic status, needed some kind of political alternative realistic or not before they would become revolutionaries. At the time, these alternatives were offered by peasant leaders who appealed to the traditional and customary law Thompsons moral economy? and by politically discontented citizens who favored the new ideas of liberalism and democracy. In contrast to the crises of 1816/17, when there 53. Thompson, \"Moral Economy.\" 32 was still hope that the forces of restoration would not dominate, the crisis of 1845-48 took place in the context of a much larger and more popular variety of political alternatives that called for immediate action.>* At least here we see historical singularities. The fact that ideas served as a catalyst for an upheaval initiated by economic factors transcends a narrow economistic approach. But although the economic crises did not provide the brains, they did provide the muscles. The opinion leaders, who pursued their ideals in an undemocratic and often repressive political environment, needed violence (or the credible threat of it) as a political instrument, and only the crowd could provide it. Hobsbawm has termed this *bargaining by riot.> We conclude that without the economic crisis of 1845-48, which so obviously endangered the economic welfare of so many and discredited the ancien regime, there would not have been the critical mass to support these new ideas. Hence the explanation of European revolutions of 1848 should not neglect short-term economic factors. 54 The similar food price increase of 1854/55 created neither famine nor social unrest, see Charles, Louise, and Richard Tilly, Rebellious Century. 5 Hobsbawm, \"Machine Breakers,\" p.", "tokens": 285, "label": "medium"}

For the conversion of currencies, measures of capacity, and measures of weight we used Klimpert, Lexikon, at times checked by and supplemented with data in other literature on the subject. As both the levels and the volatility of the data are strongly influenced by the way the average is calculated, we ignored series for the harvest year or ones which relied only on one or two dates per year.

We show that foreign currency currency exposure in international exposure meaningfully adds to risk in most environments, and does so without providing commensurate compensation.

Introduction While the recent surge in the value of the U.S. dollar has created winners and losers among currency managers, it has proven to be a thorn in the side of another set of investors: those running unhedged international equity portfolios in the U.S. Consider an investor holding an unhedged passive market-weighted portfolio of world equities. In effect, the investor is holding two portfolios a locally denominated market- weighted portfolio of these equities plus a basket of foreign (with the determined by the passive equity portfolio).* currencies weights Sharp losses in this second component of the portfolio over $1 trillion for U.S. pension plans in unhedged portfolios between July 2014 and March 2015 according to some estimates* has sparked renewed interest in the question of optimal foreign currency hedging. While hedging would clearly have been beneficial for U.S. investors in the most recent period, what is the long term case for strategic currency hedging? From a risk-reward perspective, we find that while the equity component of international portfolios makes good economic sense, there is less economic justification for the implicit currency basket. Foreign currency exposure typically adds meaningful risk to international", "tokens": 369, "label": "medium"}

While a trend of globalization and cross border holdings creates a challenge to this assumption (e.g., LeGraw (2015)), unless foreign companies are purely holding U.S. assets, there is still foreign currency exposure. To that end, empirical evidence suggests that unhedged international equity returns have not seen a decrease in their foreign currency component: the beta of unhedged foreign country returns to currency returns, increased on average from 0.9 to 1.1, when comparing the 1995-2015 period to the 1975-1995 period, with 13 of 20 countries showing increases. This might be driven by companies hedging their foreign currency exposure, effectively denominating their assets in their home countries. A separate point to note is that the trend of internationalization could mean investors face implicit currency exposure in domestic equity allocations, leading to a greater correlation between domestic equity positions and unhedged equity positions.

Historically, this approach might have been justified as additional trading (with associated costs and operational complexity) is required to achieve a hedged position. However, the increase in size and liquidity of currency derivative markets have made the cost trivial the cost of hedging a developed international equity portfolio using quarterly currency forwards is estimated at under 5 basis points per year, according to AQR transaction cost estimates accounting for quarterly rolls and rebalances due to index weight changes. This estimate is based on an international portfolio size of roughly $5BN. For much larger portfolios, costs could be greater and therefore erode the benefits of currency hedging. Moreover, we feel strongly that this use of derivatives, while introducing financial leverage and additional instruments to the portfolio, is still risk reducing, as it hedges economic exposures (e.g., see Asness, Kabiller and Mendelson (2010)). 2 Risk Without Reward: The Case for Strategic FX Hedging\nassumptions of mean, volatility and correlations of the underlying assets. For currencies to be a good addition to a portfolio, they should be expected to enhance returns per unit of risk by some combination of adding to returns or reducing portfolio risk. However, they appear to do neither for U.S. investors: foreign currencies as an asset class do not typically offer high expected returns ex ante, yet they almost always have meaningful stand-alone risk. In the context of a portfolio, we find that they would have to be negatively correlated to other exposures in order to reduce risk. In fact, to justify the magnitude of currency exposures found in an unhedged international equity portfolio, this correlation would have to be as low as -o.5. This has never been the case historically for a U.S. investor! Simply put, provides full exposure to global currencies, exposes the investor to too much risk without an unhedged portfolio, which enough reward. From an academic perspective, the literature is quite clear that the optimal portfolio involves some amount of currency hedging.

For an alternative view, see Froot (1993) and LeGraw (2015). persistently negatively correlated with equity markets often the case in high yielding countries like Australia would have a greater incentive to holding foreign currencies as a portfolio diversifier. Even in these cases, the optimal currency exposure may not be as much as is found in an unhedged portfolio. In addition, the parsimonious approach explored here can be extended in a number of directions, including: - Considering variable allocations by foreign currency - Using style-based active factors to drive dynamic tilts from strategic allocations allocations (beyond just the international equity component) to evaluate risk contributions in - Incorporating other portfolio more holistic terms. ll. .AMean-Variance Optimal Approach to Currency Allocation To answer the question of optimal currency hedging, we start by considering whether a mean- variance optimizing (MVO) investor should have any desire for foreign currency exposure. As in the standard MVO problem, we focus on an investor attempting to maximize expected return subject to a given level of risk in their portfolio. The key inputs to this problem are the expected of the underlying assets; all else equal, investors should prefer assets with higher expected return, lower returns, variances and _ correlations variance and lower (or even negative) correlation. Our case study is a U.S. investor holding a hypothetical passive market-capitalization- weighted portfolio of hedged international equities and seeking to decide how much Note that in cases when negative correlations are driven by a country having high yields, foreign currencies often have had a corresponding negative return in other words, while reducing volatility, foreign currency exposures might still not be optimal from a risk adjusted return perspective.

As such, these currency styles are more relevant for an active trading strategy capable of responding to changes in underlying inputs. Conversely, they could not be as effectively implemented via a passive long-term strategic currency allocation. It is therefore beyond our scope to evaluate more active strategies. Empirical evidence is largely consistent with this strong prior of very low expected returns for passive currency exposures. Exhibit 1 graphs the cumulative excess returns on an unhedged international equity portfolio (in blue) and a hedged international equity portfolio (in red). The difference between the two can be attributed to the foreign currency component of the unhedged portfolio returns (in green). As the exhibit shows, while stocks had meaningful positive returns over this period, the cumulative\nt The U.S. dollar has seen a number of shifts from being a low yielding currency to a high yielding one and back in the period from 1975-2015. Investors from certain other currencies have experienced more static carry views: the Australian dollar and Japanese yen are today considered the prototypical high- and low-yielding currencies, respectively. An Australian investor might, on average, therefore perceive negative expected returns from foreign currency exposure on average, while the opposite would be true for a Japanese investor. Interestingly, even these views would not always have been true ex ante historically. As of June 1980, Japan had one of the highest short term interest rates among developed countries, while in August 1992 Australia had one of the lowest interest rates. This hedged equity return is similar to, but not identical to, local currency returns on equities. In practice, foreign currency risk cannot be perfectly hedged ex ante as investors in a given period do not know the exact value of their investment in the following period in foreign currency terms (it depends on returns to the asset during the period). The error in hedging amounts to the product of currency and stock returns, and tends to be small in size. 4 Risk Without Reward: The Case for Strategic FX Hedging Exhibit 1 Cumulative Hypothetical Excess Returns 250% 200% 150% 100% 50% 0% 50% 100% om X ~Q 2\" 2\" 2\" N 5 DD ~ PPS == Unhedged Equities Source: AQR.

While FX rates tend to reflect the relative economic conditions between two countries. Consider, for example, the potential benefit of foreign currency exposure as an inflation hedge. The argument is that in times of high inflation, investors will see foreign currencies appreciate (due to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)), even as other parts of their portfolio, such as equities, underperform. However, the PPP argument only holds true insofar as the U.S. experiences relatively high inflation compared to _ other countries. If foreign countries experience similarly high inflation at the same time, as might be expected in a commodity shock for should not expect a example, investors meaningful change in the exchange rate.* ' To that end, emerging market currencies may be more effective inflation hedges for U.S. investors than developed currencies, given that their inflation cycles are expected to be less correlated to that of the U.S. More broadly, investors might better address inflation sensitivity at the portfolio level by an explicit allocation to real return strategies, rather than relying on incidental developed currency exposure from international portfolios. Based on this complication, as well as the additional competing effects outlined above, expectations for the correlation between the international equity portfolio and the currency basket will vary across time and across base currencies. Indeed, the evidence in the academic literature on co-movements between currencies and equities is somewhat mixed. It is not nearly sufficient to support a prediction of strong negative correlation between international equities and foreign currencies for a U.S. investor; yet as previously mentioned, a correlation as low as -O.5 would be required to justify a fully unhedged position.

In order to justify the significant currency allocation found in an unhedged international equity allocation, one would have to assume either meaningful positive returns to foreign currencies, or hedging properties that would reduce risk in a portfolio context. We didnt find either of these in the historic sample; our conclusion is that we would expect some 8 Some non-U.S. investors might find more of a case based on correlations. In a study of G7 countries, we found that while the U.S. has time varying correlations with an average of close to O, certain countries tend to have positive correlations on average, while others tend to have negative. Negative correlations were typically associated with high yielders or commodity exporting countries. While there was just 1 country for which the long term correlation was negative enough to warrant a preference for unhedged equities for a volatility minimizing investor, several countries experienced sub-samples during which foreign currency exposures reduced volatility. Nonetheless, unless these sub-samples are predictable ex ante, investors in these countries might still benefit from hedging on a strategic basis. amount of currency hedging to have been beneficial to an investor looking to maximize risk adjusted returns. lll.

A simple result documented in the literature, for example, is that higher yielding currencies have typically had higher correlations to equity markets hedging these currencies might result in the most meaningful reduction in volatility (though this volatility reduction might come at the cost of negative returns, given that high yielding currencies tend to earn positive excess returns over lower yielding currencies over the long term). Accounting for carry differentials (or any other dynamic variable) would constitute a dynamic hedging strategy. We focus here on the truly passive strategy. 8 Risk Without Reward: The Case for Strategic FX Hedging Table 1 International Equity Portfolios With Different Target Currency Exposure (1975-2015) Excess Currencies Average Excess Return 0.3% 5 3% ! 5 3% Standard Deviation 76% 14.6% | 14.5% Sharpe 0.04 036 + 0.37 Max LY Drawdown -23.0% 56.6% + -60.4% Max Drawdown from Peak -66.9% -78.6% | -77.5% Source: AQR.", "tokens": 1108, "label": "heavy"}

Focusing on a comparison between a zero-currency exposure (hedged) portfolio and full-currency exposure (unhedged) portfolio, we see a volatility reduction of almost 15%, driving an almost commensurate Sharpe ratio increase (the volatility offset was slightly offset by a reduction in returns from hedging over this period)**. The impact on drawdowns is even more dramatic: over 1/5 of the worst 1-year drawdown of -78.7% for unhedged equities could have been avoided by currency hedging.** While we recognize that volatility and drawdowns are not the only measures of risk, we think they do capture relevant dimensions that investors should (and do) care about. One natural question is whether this volatility reduction was consistent, or concentrated in a specific sub-period. Exhibit 5 shows the ratio of rolling 3-year realized volatilities of the zero- currency exposure vs. full-currency exposure portfolio.

In other words, currency exposure rarely provided meaningful hedging benefits. Overall, directly analyzing the historical impact of currency hedging led to results consistent with priors from our mean-variance optimization framework: the high standalone risk of currencies means that it is difficult to find an economic environment in which full-currency exposure is risk reducing. A decision to allocate full-currency exposure via an unhedged international equity portfolio represents an overly concentrated bet on this historically rare type of environment. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that while currency hedging would have helped U.S. investors historically, conditions could change to affect this conclusion. As highlighted in our earlier MVO framework, for currency exposures to be helpful to U.S. investor international equity portfolios, they would have to become significantly negatively correlated to the equities themselves. While this was not the case in our data sample, and we do not expect it be the case going forward, there are clearly states of the world in which it could be. Consider two examples: First, increasing globalization trends in company cash flows could be sufficient to reduce the extent to which foreign equity investments embed currency risk.

There would therefore be meaningful hedging benefits to foreign currency allocation. Second, we could see an increased prevalence or magnitude of the types of economic shocks that tend to move equities and currencies in opposite directions (the opposing reactions of the Swiss franc and Swiss Market Index following the recent Swiss National Bank decision to abandon their exchange rate floor is a good example). The historical near-zero (mild positive) correlation between foreign hedged equities and currencies indicate a balance between this type of shock and those that tend to drive equities and currencies in the same direction, but of course this could change in the future. Yet, most economic decisions come with some uncertainty and therefore the possibility of being <* It is probably worth mentioning that in this extreme example, U.S. stock returns would become negatively correlated to the dollar, thereby implicitly giving investors foreign currency exposure in their domestic stock allocations.

IV. Conclusion The analysis presented in this paper considers a straightforward case of a U.S. investor holding an international equity portfolio and attempting to directly target currency exposures in an optimal way. The results show that: 1) Inthe long term, foreign developed currencies have earned a very low level of return, consistent with economic intuition. 2) The standalone risk of foreign currencies is not trivial, and typically about half that of domestic equities. 3) The correlation between foreign currencies and domestic equity returns varies over time, but was slightly positive on average and rarely significantly negative. Therefore, a volatility minimizing, or mean- variance optimizing investor would not favor an 10 Risk Without Reward: The Case for Strategic FX Hedging\nunhedged portfolio. While some amounts of currency risk can provide diversification benefits during certain time periods, the amount found in an unhedged portfolio may be too great, if historical conditions persist. A more optimal allocation, achieved via a currency hedging program, should allow investors to achieve a more desirable risk profile without a meaningful sacrifice in terms of expected returns. As a final comment, note that the analysis and conclusions presented in this paper result from several simplifying assumptions including a zero expected return for foreign currencies, a constant hedge ratio across all foreign currencies and the choice of a single hedge ratio to use in all time periods. Shorter term views on conditional returns or correlations, motivated by economic environments (e.g., inflation and economic erowth) or styles (e.g., currency carry) and customized to each individual foreign currency, can be used to further improve return and risk characteristics. Nonetheless, their time varying nature mean that they are best left to dynamic hedging programs, with the agility and flexibility to effectively take advantage of this information, and implemented with a risk allocation appropriate to their expected efficacy. Additionally, an investor would be well advised to consider decisions of optimal currency targeting at an overall portfolio level which can incorporate implicit currency exposure from all international allocations, and additional information from correlations of currencies to all component asset classes.

Introduction While the recent surge in the value of the U.S. dollar has created winners and losers among currency managers, it has proven to be a thorn in the side of another set of investors: those running unhedged international equity portfolios in the U.S. Consider an investor holding an unhedged passive market-weighted portfolio of world equities. In effect, the investor is holding two portfolios a locally denominated market- weighted portfolio of these equities plus a basket of foreign (with the determined by the passive equity portfolio).* currencies weights Sharp losses in this second component of the portfolio over $1 trillion for U.S. pension plans in unhedged portfolios between July 2014 and March 2015 according to some estimates* has sparked renewed interest in the question of optimal foreign currency hedging. While hedging would clearly have been beneficial for U.S. investors in the most recent period, what is the long term case for strategic currency hedging? From a risk-reward perspective, we find that while the equity component of international portfolios makes good economic sense, there is less economic justification for the implicit currency basket.

While a trend of globalization and cross border holdings creates a challenge to this assumption (e.g., LeGraw (2015)), unless foreign companies are purely holding U.S. assets, there is still foreign currency exposure. To that end, empirical evidence suggests that unhedged international equity returns have not seen a decrease in their foreign currency component: the beta of unhedged foreign country returns to currency returns, increased on average from 0.9 to 1.1, when comparing the 1995-2015 period to the 1975-1995 period, with 13 of 20 countries showing increases. This might be driven by companies hedging their foreign currency exposure, effectively denominating their assets in their home countries. A separate point to note is that the trend of internationalization could mean investors face implicit currency exposure in domestic equity allocations, leading to a greater correlation between domestic equity positions and unhedged equity positions.

Historically, this approach might have been justified as additional trading (with associated costs and operational complexity) is required to achieve a hedged position. However, the increase in size and liquidity of currency derivative markets have made the cost trivial the cost of hedging a developed international equity portfolio using quarterly currency forwards is estimated at under 5 basis points per year, according to AQR transaction cost estimates accounting for quarterly rolls and rebalances due to index weight changes. This estimate is based on an international portfolio size of roughly $5BN. For much larger portfolios, costs could be greater and therefore erode the benefits of currency hedging. Moreover, we feel strongly that this use of derivatives, while introducing financial leverage and additional instruments to the portfolio, is still risk reducing, as it hedges economic exposures (e.g., see Asness, Kabiller and Mendelson (2010)). 2 Risk Without Reward: The Case for Strategic FX Hedging\nassumptions of mean, volatility and correlations of the underlying assets. For currencies to be a good addition to a portfolio, they should be expected to enhance returns per unit of risk by some combination of adding to returns or reducing portfolio risk. However, they appear to do neither for U.S. investors: foreign currencies as an asset class do not typically offer high expected returns ex ante, yet they almost always have meaningful stand-alone risk. In the context of a portfolio, we find that they would have to be negatively correlated to other exposures in order to reduce risk. In fact, to justify the magnitude of currency exposures found in an unhedged international equity portfolio, this correlation would have to be as low as -o.5. This has never been the case historically for a U.S. investor! Simply put, provides full exposure to global currencies, exposes the investor to too much risk without an unhedged portfolio, which enough reward.

For an alternative view, see Froot (1993) and LeGraw (2015). persistently negatively correlated with equity markets often the case in high yielding countries like Australia would have a greater incentive to holding foreign currencies as a portfolio diversifier. Even in these cases, the optimal currency exposure may not be as much as is found in an unhedged portfolio. In addition, the parsimonious approach explored here can be extended in a number of directions, including: - Considering variable allocations by foreign currency - Using style-based active factors to drive dynamic tilts from strategic allocations allocations (beyond just the international equity component) to evaluate risk contributions in - Incorporating other portfolio more holistic terms. ll. .AMean-Variance Optimal Approach to Currency Allocation To answer the question of optimal currency hedging, we start by considering whether a mean- variance optimizing (MVO) investor should have any desire for foreign currency exposure. As in the standard MVO problem, we focus on an investor attempting to maximize expected return subject to a given level of risk in their portfolio. The key inputs to this problem are the expected of the underlying assets; all else equal, investors should prefer assets with higher expected return, lower returns, variances and _ correlations variance and lower (or even negative) correlation. Our case study is a U.S. investor holding a hypothetical passive market-capitalization- weighted portfolio of hedged international equities and seeking to decide how much Note that in cases when negative correlations are driven by a country having high yields, foreign currencies often have had a corresponding negative return in other words, while reducing volatility, foreign currency exposures might still not be optimal from a risk adjusted return perspective.

That is not to say that it is impossible to generate positive returns by trading currencies; academics have described certain styles dictating long/short currency portfolios with positive expected returns, but these are inherently dynamic in nature.

Consider the trivial case of a world with just two countries, and one exchange rate linking the two. Expected foreign currency returns for investors in country A would be roughly the negation of those for investors in country B, i.e., both could not be significantly positive. If returns were very small, it would be technically feasible for both to achieve positive returns, as described by Siegel's Paradox in Black (1989), but the magnitude of returns would not be of economic interest.

For example, the profitability of the currency momentum trading strategy would indicate positive expected returns to foreign currencies for U.S. investors following periods of dollar weakening, but negative expected returns following dollar rallies. While other currency styles, particularly carry, can be more persistent, they are still based on inherently dynamic inputs and can therefore have meaningful changes in their views on expected return for a given currency. As such, these currency styles are more relevant for an active trading strategy capable of responding to changes in underlying inputs. Conversely, they could not be as effectively implemented via a passive long-term strategic currency allocation. It is therefore beyond our scope to evaluate more active strategies. Empirical evidence is largely consistent with this strong prior of very low expected returns for passive currency exposures. Exhibit 1 graphs the cumulative excess returns on an unhedged international equity portfolio (in blue) and a hedged international equity portfolio (in red).

Investors from certain other currencies have experienced more static carry views: the Australian dollar and Japanese yen are today considered the prototypical high- and low-yielding currencies, respectively. An Australian investor might, on average, therefore perceive negative expected returns from foreign currency exposure on average, while the opposite would be true for a Japanese investor. Interestingly, even these views would not always have been true ex ante historically. As of June 1980, Japan had one of the highest short term interest rates among developed countries, while in August 1992 Australia had one of the lowest interest rates. This hedged equity return is similar to, but not identical to, local currency returns on equities. In practice, foreign currency risk cannot be perfectly hedged ex ante as investors in a given period do not know the exact value of their investment in the following period in foreign currency terms (it depends on returns to the asset during the period). The error in hedging amounts to the product of currency and stock returns, and tends to be small in size. 4 Risk Without Reward: The Case for Strategic FX Hedging Exhibit 1 Cumulative Hypothetical Excess Returns 250% 200% 150% 100% 50% 0% 50% 100% om X ~Q 2\" 2\" 2\" N 5 DD ~ PPS == Unhedged Equities Source: AQR.

While FX rates tend to reflect the relative economic conditions between two countries. Consider, for example, the potential benefit of foreign currency exposure as an inflation hedge.

Based on this complication, as well as the additional competing effects outlined above, expectations for the correlation between the international equity portfolio and the currency basket will vary across time and across base currencies. Indeed, the evidence in the academic literature on co-movements between currencies and equities is somewhat mixed. It is not nearly sufficient to support a prediction of strong negative correlation between international equities and foreign currencies for a U.S. investor; yet as previously mentioned, a correlation as low as -O.5 would be required to justify a fully unhedged position.

In order to justify the significant currency allocation found in an unhedged international equity allocation, one would have to assume either meaningful positive returns to foreign currencies, or hedging properties that would reduce risk in a portfolio context. We didnt find either of these in the historic sample; our conclusion is that we would expect some 8 Some non-U.S. investors might find more of a case based on correlations. In a study of G7 countries, we found that while the U.S. has time varying correlations with an average of close to O, certain countries tend to have positive correlations on average, while others tend to have negative. Negative correlations were typically associated with high yielders or commodity exporting countries. While there was just 1 country for which the long term correlation was negative enough to warrant a preference for unhedged equities for a volatility minimizing investor, several countries experienced sub-samples during which foreign currency exposures reduced volatility. Nonetheless, unless these sub-samples are predictable ex ante, investors in these countries might still benefit from hedging on a strategic basis. amount of currency hedging to have been beneficial to an investor looking to maximize risk adjusted returns. lll.

A simple result documented in the literature, for example, is that higher yielding currencies have typically had higher correlations to equity markets hedging these currencies might result in the most meaningful reduction in volatility (though this volatility reduction might come at the cost of negative returns, given that high yielding currencies tend to earn positive excess returns over lower yielding currencies over the long term). Accounting for carry differentials (or any other dynamic variable) would constitute a dynamic hedging strategy.

In other words, currency exposure rarely provided meaningful hedging benefits. Overall, directly analyzing the historical impact of currency hedging led to results consistent with priors from our mean-variance optimization framework: the high standalone risk of currencies means that it is difficult to find an economic environment in which full-currency exposure is risk reducing. A decision to allocate full-currency exposure via an unhedged international equity portfolio represents an overly concentrated bet on this historically rare type of environment. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that while currency hedging would have helped U.S. investors historically, conditions could change to affect this conclusion. As highlighted in our earlier MVO framework, for currency exposures to be helpful to U.S. investor international equity portfolios, they would have to become significantly negatively correlated to the equities themselves. While this was not the case in our data sample, and we do not expect it be the case going forward, there are clearly states of the world in which it could be. Consider two examples: First, increasing globalization trends in company cash flows could be sufficient to reduce the extent to which foreign equity investments embed currency risk.

There would therefore be meaningful hedging benefits to foreign currency allocation. Second, we could see an increased prevalence or magnitude of the types of economic shocks that tend to move equities and currencies in opposite directions (the opposing reactions of the Swiss franc and Swiss Market Index following the recent Swiss National Bank decision to abandon their exchange rate floor is a good example). The historical near-zero (mild positive) correlation between foreign hedged equities and currencies indicate a balance between this type of shock and those that tend to drive equities and currencies in the same direction, but of course this could change in the future.

Our preferred approach is to do what makes most sense from a strategic perspective considering long term empirical evidence and the economic intuition that underpins it - in this case, reduce currency exposures via strategic hedging. IV. Conclusion The analysis presented in this paper considers a straightforward case of a U.S. investor holding an international equity portfolio and attempting to directly target currency exposures in an optimal way. The results show that: 1) Inthe long term, foreign developed currencies have earned a very low level of return, consistent with economic intuition. 2) The standalone risk of foreign currencies is not trivial, and typically about half that of domestic equities. 3) The correlation between foreign currencies and domestic equity returns varies over time, but was slightly positive on average and rarely significantly negative. Therefore, a volatility minimizing, or mean- variance optimizing investor would not favor an 10 Risk Without Reward: The Case for Strategic FX Hedging\nunhedged portfolio. While some amounts of currency risk can provide diversification benefits during certain time periods, the amount found in an unhedged portfolio may be too great, if historical conditions persist. A more optimal allocation, achieved via a currency hedging program, should allow investors to achieve a more desirable risk profile without a meaningful sacrifice in terms of expected returns. As a final comment, note that the analysis and conclusions presented in this paper result from several simplifying assumptions including a zero expected return for foreign currencies, a constant hedge ratio across all foreign currencies and the choice of a single hedge ratio to use in all time periods. Shorter term views on conditional returns or correlations, motivated by economic environments (e.g., inflation and economic erowth) or styles (e.g., currency carry) and customized to each individual foreign currency, can be used to further improve return and risk characteristics. Nonetheless, their time varying nature mean that they are best left to dynamic hedging programs, with the agility and flexibility to effectively take advantage of this information, and implemented with a risk allocation appropriate to their expected efficacy. Additionally, an investor would be well advised to consider decisions of optimal currency targeting at an overall portfolio level which can incorporate implicit currency exposure from all international allocations, and additional information from correlations of currencies to all component asset classes.

Strong performance in the midst of the Global Financial Crisis later gave way to more modest returns until another strong run from mid- 2013 through early-2015. More recently, trend followings performance has been challenging. Recent challenges prompt several key questions about the strategy and long-term expectations. To start, it is important to highlight that trend following is a long- established investment approach with a history that dates back to at least the eighteenth century. Managed futures funds became publicly available starting in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In this piece, we use live data of trend-focused managers starting in 2000 via the SG Trend Index to contextualize recent performance and to re-affirm the merits of the strategy.

Exhibit 7 shows the historical drawdown profile of trend managers and the drawdown profile of a 60/40 stock-bond portfolio.* We consider and compare the drawdown profiles of both strategies as trend managers and a global 60/40 portfolio have had similar levels of realized volatility over the long term. Analyzing a long history of live returns for trend-following managers shows that drawdowns are to be expected. Notably, this most recent drawdown is commensurate with the magnitude of other large drawdowns. Thus while the recent performance experience has been challenging, it is not uncharacteristic of the strategy. It is also worth noting that the largest drawdowns in a traditional portfolio have been significantly more severe than those of trend managers historically.

A key feature of trend following is its uncorrelated relationship with traditional stock and bond investments. While this is true over the long term, one of the core benefits of trend following is its tendency to be negatively correlated during difficult periods for a traditional portfolio. Exhibit 2 below demonstrates this tendency. The exhibit also suggests that during difficult periods for trend following, there does not appear to be a strong correlation or relationship between trend following and the returns to a traditional portfolio.

Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. For Illustrative purposes only and not representative of any strategy that AQR currently manages. Trend's value as a diversifying strategy may be difficult to appreciate when traditional portfolios are doing well. Recently, trend following showed its merit as global equities saw a prolonged but relatively shallow decline in late- 2015 and early-2016, and trend followers delivered positive returns. That example aside, equity markets have generally produced benign and positive annual returns since the Global Financial Crisis.* This is not the type of environment where trend following tends to excel, but does serve as an important reminder that investment decisions made based on recent history may not fully reflect future possibilities. Is industry size a problem? Not likely. Some looking for an explanation of recent difficult performance for trend following point to industry size as problematic. However, this argument breaks down when analyzing the data. Assets invested in trend-following strategies have declined over the last decade. Industry assets peaked in mid-2008 at approximately $211 billion, and have largely fallen since. More recent estimates of industry size show roughly $124 billion invested in trend- following strategies. More broadly, assets in quantitative strategies overall are still only a fraction of total hedge fund assets, and are an even smaller fraction of actively managed assets. * Source: Bloomberg.

Estimates of industry assets may not capture the exposure of bank swaps, which we estimate at roughly $350 billion in AUM equivalent for alternative risk premia. Even after accounting for the portion of these additional exposures that represent trend following, the trend-following industry is still relatively modest in size. For example, systematic hedge fund strategies are estimated to account for approximately $500 billion in AUM, or 17% of hedge fund industry assets. There are also an additional roughly $100 billion in risk premia product offered by hedge funds and other managers, and roughly $500 billion in premium long only quant products.

{"text": "Please read important disclosures in the Appendix. For Illustrative purposes only and not representative of any strategy that AQR currently manages. Trend following is a good strategy going through a tough time A natural question during difficult performance is whether the strategy is somehow broken. Looking carefully at the underlying dynamics of the current drawdown, we find evidence that recent performance is not a result of a broken process, but is due to a macro environment that produced very few meaningful trends in markets since mid-2016. Interestingly, trend followers do not need a majority of the markets they trade to exhibit large moves in order to be profitable. Trend followers will exit their losing trades, minimizing losses, and will continue to hold onto winning trades as long as those trends continue. The end result is that, typically, a minority of markets exhibiting sizable and prolonged trends tend to generate returns that outweigh the comparatively small losses realized elsewhere. One way to measure the opportunity set for trend followers is to examine the number and magnitude of large consistent market moves, positive or negative, over any given year. This is an intuitive and objective measure that is strongly correlated to trend-following returns. Exhibit 5 below shows, for each year since 2000, the set of markets that experienced an above-average risk-adjusted move, with shading indicating the degree of magnitude and consistency of the move.

{"text": "Expectations should be informed by a long-term view. In statistics, many data points are required to inform reasonable expectations. In the shorter term, when too few data points are considered, realizations can deviate from long-term expectations sometimes considerably. For example, a strategy that experiences 5% annualized excess returns over the long term is equally likely, in any given year, to experience excess returns greater than 15.0% as it is to see returns worse than -5.0% above cash, assuming a symmetric distribution. Recently, hypothetical example helps illustrate this point. Consider a 10% targeted-volatility investment strategy that is known, with certainty, to be a 0.5 Sharpe strategy (i.e., generates a +5.0% return excess of cash). This strategy will go through periods where it realizes greater than a 1.5 Sharpe (+15.0% excess returns), and periods of time where it realizes less than a -0.5 Sharpe (-5.0% excess returns).

Conclusion Digging into the dynamics behind recent performance challenges for trend followers gives us confidence that the strategy is in fact behaving as expected, and a lean opportunity set in markets is the culprit behind poor performance. As such, we continue to anchor our expectations for trend following to the long-term evidence. Going forward, we expect trend following to continue to serve as a meaningfully additive and diversifying allocation to traditional investor portfolios. AQR, Bloomberg.

The outperformance of Risk Parity strategies during the recent credit crisis has provided evidence of the benefits of a truly diversified porttolio. Traditional diversification focuses on dollar allocation; but because equities have disproportionate risk, a traditional portfolio overall risk is often dominated by its equity portion. Risk Parity diversification focuses on risk allocation. We find that by making significant investments in non-equity asset classes, investors can achieve true diversification and expect more consistent performance across the spectrum of potential economic environments. First, the paper highlights the concentration risk embedded in traditional portfolios, and explains the intuition behind Risk Parity. Next, we describe a Simple Risk Parity Strategy and demonstrate its consistent outperformance over nearly 40 years of historical data. Finally, we delve into the more advanced portfolio construction and risk management techniques used to implement actual Risk Parity portfolios.

First, the strategy has shown more consistent long-term performance than traditional portfolios.\" Second, after significant market declines in 2008, many investors are concerned about the tail risk in their portfolios. Finally, despite the common view that diversification failed during the recent credit crisis, Risk Parity strategies passed an acid test in 2008 by performing well relative to traditional portfolios. Today, portfolio allocations to equities are typically 60% or higher. Because equities have approximately three to four times the risk of bonds, this allocation leads to a portfolio that has roughly 90% of its risk budget dedicated to equities.* In other words, when viewed through the lens of risk, traditional asset allocations are highly concentrated in the equity markets and not actually diversified at all. The concentration risk of traditional portfolios leads to lower risk-adjusted returns, less consistent performance across economic environments and higher tail risk. Exhibit 1 shows a typical portfolio broken down by both capital (dollar) allocation and risk allocation. Clearly, this traditional portfolio is dominated by equity risk, meaning that its performance over time will largely be dictated by the equity markets. The bond market can have a miserable year or an extraordinary year, commodity prices can soar or plummet, but the effect on the portfolio will nonetheless be small. Traditional portfolios give the illusion of diversification when in fact they have concentrated exposure to the equity markets. PART 2: WHAT IS THE CONCEPT BEHIND RISK PARITY? Risk Parity portfolios rely on risk-based diversification, seeking to generate both higher and more consistent returns. (More diversified portfolios have higher Sharpe Ratios.) The typical Risk Parity portfolio begins with a much lower exposure to equities relative to traditional portfolios, and invests significantly more in other asset classes. As a result, the risk budget of the portfolio is not concentrated in equities, but spread more evenly across other asset classes. The key to Risk Parity is to diversify across asset classes that behave differently across economic environments. In general, equities do well in high growth and low inflation environments, bonds do well in deflationary or recessionary environments, and commodities tend to perform best during inflationary Exhibit 1: Traditional Portfolios are Heavily Concentrated in Equity Risk. Traditional Dollar Allocation Traditional Risk Allocation m Public and Private Equity = Fixed Income ~ Real Estate = Commodities Hedge Funds\nSource: AQR. Dollar Allocation and Risk Allocation charts are for illustrative purposes only and are intended to illustrate an asset class allocation and corresponding risk allocation/exposure of the typical multi-asset class, or traditional portfolio. Risk Allocations are calculated based on AQR volatility and correlation estimates. Certain of the assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representation or warranty is made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions made or that all assumptions used in calculating risk allocations have been stated or fully considered. Comparing the simulated returns of a Simple Risk Parity portfolio versus the simulated returns of a 60% S&P 500 / 40% Barclays US Aggregate balanced portfolio from January 1971 through December 2009. ? Tail risk is defined as the risk of portfolio returns that are more than three standard deviations below the mean of a normal distribution. In other words, a very large, unexpected and rapid drawdown of capital. 3A portfolios risk budget is defined as the amount of risk that a portfolio manager is willing to take on, in order to pursue her target return. Volatility is not the same as risk, but its an important input in determining the risk of an asset. Throughout this paper, risk is measured as the volatility (standard deviation) of returns. However, the concepts presented extend to other measures of risk such as marginal risk contribution, value-at-risk (VaR), stress test based loss estimates, and other measures of risk. These risk exposures are based on AQR volatility and correlation estimates and are for illustrative purposes only. AQR Capital Management, LLC 2 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AQR environments. Having balanced exposure to these three main asset classes can produce more consistent long-term results. While there can be material differences among Risk Parity strategies, such as the breadth of asset classes used and portfolio construction methodologies employed, the concept that binds them all is a more balanced approach to risk allocation. Exhibit 2 shows the Sharpe Ratios of these three asset classes over the thirty-nine years from 1971 to 2009.7 Over the long term, the risk-adjusted returns are nearly identical, although there has been performance dispersion over shorter time periods. Regardless of asset class, investors have been paid, on average, about the same amount to bear risk which is why a portfolio constructed to weight the risk of each asset class similarly makes sense in the long term. In contrast, the more common equity risk concentrated portfolio is consistent with the idea that risk-adjusted returns of equities are far greater than that of the other asset classes, despite many decades of evidence suggesting otherwise. To illustrate this point, we present a stylized Simple Risk Parity Strategy which invests in only three asset classes (Exhibit 3). The intuition is straightforward: instead of Exhibit 2: Risk-Adjusted Performance is Similar Across Asset Classes from 1971 to 2009. taking a single large concentrated risk in equities, investors should diversify with several more balanced risks and expect more consistent returns with lower tail risk. PART 3: CONSTRUCTING AND TESTING A SIMPLE RISK PARITY STRATEGY To demonstrate how these strategies work, we construct a Simple Risk Parity Strategy (or Strategy) and compare this simulated portfolio to a typical 60/40 simulated portfolio. In practice, many Risk Parity strategies provide exposure to a wider range of asset classes. Here, for simplicity, we construct the Strategy using only three widely available commercial indices: the MSCI World Index, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Government Index, and the S&P GSCI Index, representing exposures to equities, bonds, and commodities, respectively. Using these three indices allows us to analyze Risk Parity from as early as 1971, examining the historical performance characteristics through a number of different business cycles and market environments. Risk Parity by definition aims for equal risk across asset classes, and for this study we will target a similar amount of volatility from each asset class every month.

{"text": "For comparison purposes, we scale the portfolio so that the average annualized volatility of this portfolio matches the volatility of the\n60/40 portfolio over the period. This methodology ensures that a lot less capital is allocated to high volatility asset classes (e.g., equities). As a result, these risks will not dominate the portfolio since exposures to lower volatility assets are increased to balance risks. As volatility estimates change, the holdings of Risky Parity portfolios also shift accordingly to maintain the desired diversification. We think targeting and controlling the overall portfolio volatility can also lead to more consistent returns. As the volatility of an asset increases (decreases), the position size in the portfolio will be decreased (increased) accordingly. This is in stark contrast to traditional portfolios which are typically rebalanced to a constant capital allocation percentage. This means the volatility of a traditional portfolio may vary significantly over time, mainly due to changes in market volatility. Exhibit 4 compares the historical performance of the Strategy to a traditional 60/40 portfolio. The Strategy has delivered higher returns (an additional 1.7% per year) at the same annualized volatility over the past 39 years, resulting in a Sharpe Ratio that is more than 60% higher. This significant increase in risk-adjusted returns is due to superior portfolio construction techniques and improved risk diversification. The Strategy would have delivered more consistent performance and reduced drawdowns due to improved diversification, but it wouldn't have outperformed in every environment. Exhibit 4 indicates how the Simple Risk Parity Strategy may have performed through specific historical scenarios. In the early 1970s, inflation was out of control, leading President Nixon to impose wage and price controls on August 15, 1971. While inflation dipped initially, commodity prices continued climbing, accentuated by the 1973 OPEC oil embargo.

The Simple Risk Parity portfolio would have outperformed the 60/40 portfolio by over 45% during this period. The 1982 bull market is an example where the 60/40 portfolio would have outperformed the Simple Risk Parity Strategy. This is to be expected, as during this period equities were the best performing asset class on a risk-adjusted basis. While underperforming 60/40, the Simple Risk Parity Strategy still would have performed well on an absolute basis in this type of environment. Importantly, the Simple Risk Parity Strategy doesnt necessarily underperform in bull markets, as evidenced by the results over the Tech Bubble and during the Easy Credit years in the mid 2000s. The surprise hike of the Fed Funds rate in February 1994 is an example of an environment that was tough for most portfolios. This is also an example where Risk Parity may underperform more traditional asset allocations as fixed income suffered relatively more than equities on a risk-adjusted basis. Equity bear markets like the 1987 Market Crash, the Tech Bust and the recent Credit Crisis are all environments where Risk Parity has significantly outperformed more traditional asset allocations. By having material exposure to assets that perform well in these environments, such as government bonds, Risk Parity portfolios would have managed to largely preserve and in some cases grow capital during equity bear markets. In addition to providing better risk-adjusted returns, the Risk Parity approach is more resilient to different economic environments than a traditional 60/40 portfolio.

A portfolio that concentrates in just one of these risk sources is subject to significant concentration risk. If that asset class generates low or negative returns over an extended period of time, the concentrated portfolio will suffer. For example, during the inflationary decade of the 1970s, commodities were the best-performing asset class. The 1980s was a decade where all three asset classes performed generally well. During the deflationary period of the 1990s, both stocks and bonds performed well while commodities offered little. Over the last decade, marred by two large recessions with an asset and credit bubble in between, only bonds have given investors healthy returns. Through all of this, returns to the Simple Risk Parity Strategy have been consistently positive due to the broad risk diversification. PART 4: IMPLEMENTING ACTUAL RISK PARITY PORTFOLIOS Thus far, we have only described a simplified approach to Risk Parity. In this section, we begin by revisiting the theory behind why Risk Parity should outperform more concentrated portfolios, and we conclude with a discussion of more advanced portfolio construction and risk management techniques commonly used in the actual implementation of Risk Parity strategies. Unlevered Risk Parity portfolios may be attractive due to their high risk-adjusted returns and reduced tail risk, but the nominal expected returns may be too low to meet an investors desired return. To address this concern, the diversified Risk Parity portfolio can be scaled to match an investors expected return.

AQR Capital Management, LLC 6 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AQR This idea took root starting in the 1950s, when Harry Markowitz' first described the concept of allocating to different mixtures of assets to form the efficient frontiers as shown in the red and blue lines in Exhibit 6. James Tobin'! then demonstrated that all investors should hold some combination of a diversified portfolio (the portfolio that lies where the green line meets the blue efficient frontier line, or the tangent portfolio) and cash. Borrowing and leverage have existed for a very long time, but the advent of liquid futures markets and increased access to low cost financing has allowed Risk Parity portfolios to extend these concepts by moving up the green capital market line. This enables the investor to maintain the higher Sharpe Ratio and other benefits of a diversified portfolio as the investor seeks higher returns. In this illustration, let's assume the Risk Parity portfolio is the tangency point between the blue and green lines.'* This unlevered Risk Parity porttolio has significantly less risk than the traditional 60/40 portfolio but a problem is that it also has a lower expected return. The solution is to use leverage to increase the expected return of the Risk Parity portfolio while matching the volatility of the 60/40 portfolio. The resulting Risk Parity portfolio has much higher expected returns due to the more efficient portfolio construction. In order for investors to seek higher returns, they must take on higher risk. The question is how to take that risk. The traditional approach is to concentrate in riskier assets, in particular equities. In contrast, the Risk Parity approach is to start with a diversified lower-risk portfolio and then use leverage to raise the expected return. (The use of leverage introduces its own risks, of course, particularly when investments are illiquid. To mitigate this, Risk Parity portfolios tend to invest in liquid instruments such as financial futures contracts.) Risk Parity investors believe that some leveraging of a more diversified liquid portfolio is a fundamentally better way to achieve higher returns than the traditional approach of concentrating in the riskiest assets. Next, we review the more advanced portfolio construction and risk management techniques used to manage Risk Parity portfolios. Breadth of instruments used. While the Simple Risk Parity Strategy invests in only three asset classes, actual Risk Parity portfolios can incorporate additional asset classes. Since these instruments are not perfectly correlated with each other, this further enhances the level of risk diversification and the efficiency of the total portfolio. Correlation and _ volatility forecasting. While the Simple Risk Parity Strategy targets an equal amount of risk in each asset class, a real-life implementation would incorporate correlations across different asset classes in order to equalize risk contributions. In addition, proprietary risk models can be utilized to improve volatility forecasts, which can help maintain the risk balance across asset classes and more consistent portfolio level volatility over time. Tactical over/underweights. The Simple Risk Parity approach described so far was based on an equal allocation of risk to each of three major risk categories. Indeed, some practical implementations use this passive approach to budgeting risk across these categories. However, it is also possible to use the equal risk across categories portfolio as the neutral allocation, and then over- or under-weight the risk allocations based on the managers tactical views. Different volatility targets. In the exposition above, we used\nan annualized volatility target of about 10%, which corresponds to the approximate average volatility of a 60/40 portfolio. However, by changing the amount of leverage used, it is easy to construct portfolios of an arbitrary level of volatility e.g. that of a 70/30 portfolio, 80/20 portfolio, or even a 100% equity portfolio.'* We believe that Risk Parity is a far superior approach to building target risk portfolios than those conventionally used. Trading systems and risk control. Managers can also use proprietary algorithmic trading systems in order to trade passively and reduce trading costs or market impact while adjusting position sizes. Finally, systematic portfolio level drawdown control systems can be used in order to minimize portfolio losses during challenging periods for the strategy.

When investors ask which source to use to fund an investment in Risk Parity, the natural answer is part of the existing equity allocation. The rationale for using equities as the source for funding is that most portfolios are overly exposed to equity risk and one of the main benefits of Risk Parity is that it helps to reduce equity concentration risk while still maintaining a more balanced exposure to general market risk. Here is a list of the various approaches institutions have used in determining how Risk Parity fits within their investment scheme: Core/Satellite Approach. The risk/return characteristics of Risk Parity could qualify it to be the core holding of an investment portfolio. The green line versus blue line in Exhibit 6 makes a compelling argument that no matter what an investor's risk appetite or return target is, a Risk Parity portfolio with the appropriate level of leverage should provide better expected risk- adjusted returns. This core portfolio can also be supplemented by other uncorrelated strategies, such as alternative investments. Some large institutions have moved in the direction of this core/ satellite approach to building their portfolios. Alternative investments. The use of leverage and derivative instruments, as well as the novel approach to_ portfolio construction leads a number of investors to classify Risk Parity in the alternatives bucket. It should be noted that Risk Parity portfolios, which have approximately a 0.5 correlation to equities, would be classified as a directional alternative rather than a zero beta, non-directional alternative strategy. Opportunistic or Flexible Allocation. Some investors have a bucket for opportunistic or flexible investments and it is not uncommon to see Risk Parity portfolios placed in this classification. AQR Capital Management, LLC Global Tactical Asset Allocation (GTAA). Because of the wide range of global asset classes used as well as the dynamic shifting of weights among different asset classes, GTAA portfolios are generally the most similar peer group. Indeed, some institutional consultants have even created a Risk Parity sub- category of GIAA. However, most investors do not currently have asset allocation buckets at such fine granularity. Our view is that, regardless of how Risk Parity is classified, it can be a useful tool for improving the risk/return characteristics of an overall portfolio. CONCLUSION The theory and practice behind Risk Parity strategies have gained\nincreasing ground with investors because of: e reduced equity concentration and reduced tail risk, more meaningful diversification than traditional approaches, a portfolio that is more robust in different economic environments, and an opportunity to improve the risk/return characteristics of an overall portfolio, by either enhancing return, reducing risk, or a combination of both. These potential advantages of Risk Parity have led to increased acceptance of the approach among large institutional investors. As the approach becomes more widely available, it deserves consideration by any investor seeking to build more efficient portfolios.

Author of 17 books (and counting!) his seminal book, Winning the Losers Game, now in its 6th edition, provides a powerful testament to his enduring wisdom. A eraduate of Yale College, Charley earned his M.B.A. at Harvard Business School and a Ph.D. at New York University. His professional career began at the Rockefeller Foundation, a post he landed due to a chance meeting, but where he discovered investment management was indeed his true calling. He founded investment-advisory firm Greenwich Associates in 1972 and has served as a consultant to large institutional investors, government organizations and wealthy families ever since. An active board member, Dr. Ellis is the chairman of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and he is a former trustee of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, where he chaired the Finance Committee. He has also served as a trustee at Yale University (chairing the endowments investment committee for nine years), as a trustee at Phillips Exeter Academy, as an overseer of the Stern School of Business at New York University, and served on the visiting committee of the Harvard Business School.

Ellis, founder of Greenwich Associates and author of Winning the Losers Game and other books on investing, recently sat down with Antti Ilmanen and Rodney N. Sullivan of AQR to discuss contemporary challenges in pension investing. This is the second in a series of Words From the Wise interviews to be published on AQR.com. Following is an executive summary of the fullinterview with Dr.", "tokens": 310, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Ellis. Active investment management (and investing, generally) is characterized as a losers game in which mistakes and unforced errors cause one to fall behind. As Dr. Ellis makes clear in the interview, its a game that can be won measured as persistence in outperformance but wherein success is increasingly difficult. The winning approach is simple to understand and explain, though certainly not easy to implement. Winning the active management game, he said, requires some indispensable features, importantly high moral character, good governance, and expert knowledge and execution. The conversation then turns to Yale as a case study in successful investing. Yale, while maintaining an aggressive strategic asset allocation, stresses defense in its thinking and approach. We then turn toward gaining a better understanding of the challenges facing defined-benefit and defined-contribution pension plans and the opportunities to increase the strength and reliability of these two pillars for savings and retirement, especially given the challenging environment currently facing investors, globally. We conclude with a discussion about how Charley initially came join the investment management profession, as well as an exploration of individuals and organizations that he believes stand out as exemplars of thought leadership and investment practice. Words from the Wise: Charles Ellis 1 Confronting Investing Challenges WINNING THE LOSER'S GAME Antti IImanen: You have a long and deep career in the investment profession. We are interested in learning from your perspectives and insights. Lets begin with your famous paper, The Losers Game which broadly coincided with the start of Greenwich Associates. Can you tell us about that?", "tokens": 256, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Charles Ellis: The concept really comes out of the game of tennis. The really, really good tennis players like Federer or the Williams sisters play on the same court, use the same equipment, and wear the same type of clothing although their clothing is more fancy as other people who play tennis. But its a completely different game. The pros game is a very precise, hard-hit ball, perfect sequence of shots to put the other person at a very slight disadvantage, and then drive the ball right past that opponent. Its beautiful and exhilarating to watch. They play to win.", "tokens": 100, "label": "light"}
{"text": "For us amateurs, the way to play to win is quite different. Our best way is simple: Just hit the ball back to your opponent three times on every point and you will see the other guy finding a way to lose (by unsuccessfully trying to hit winners like the pros). So, when I play tennis, the trick is to just keep the ball in play. Let the other guy hit it out or into the net. The nomenclature is kind of fun, too: Its called a losers game because the loser is in control of the outcome. Rodney Sullivan: Does that idea relate to other areas?", "tokens": 107, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Ellis: Yes. It applies to a lot of things. My father taught us as children when we were learning how to drive: dont forget about the other guy. If you pay attention, you'll see him making a mistake and you can step away from it. Slow down or speed up. Get out of that zone where he is a danger. I always like to point out that Abraham |The Losers Game] idea has become even more relevant over time even Lincoln described the purpose of an election campaign is to give the though the world has voting public good reasons to vote against your opponent. If you changed alot since watch politics, that still works. that article came out ; m1 almost 40 years ago. There are losers games all over the place. You'll find them once you get the concept. Sullivan: How does the losers game idea relate to investing? Ellis: The idea has become even more relevant over time, the world has changed a lot since that article came out almost 40 years ago. Its getting tougher and tougher to do better than the market because the market is increasingly dominated by people who are brilliant, very hard-working, have fabulous but equally fabulous information, and have been working at investing for quite a long time.

{"text": "When that article first came out, maybe 20% of the trading was by institutional investors. Now, it is maybe 97% institutional and half of all the institutional trading is by the 50 largest transactors. Who are they? Well, a bunch of them are hedge funds. And theyre all really smart and deadly serious about trying to find opportunities and to exploit them quickly. Sullivan: You address this challenge very nicely in your recent Financial Analysts Journal (FAJ) article, The Rise and Fall of Performance Investing.? Is it still possible to capture alpha in your view that is, to win at the losers game? Ellis: Sure.", "tokens": 105, "label": "light"}
{"text": "There are two ways of answering the question. One is absolutely, yes, its still possible for asmall percentage of active investors to show superior results. Its not always by a very large magnitude and has variation from year to year, but, undeniably, some succeed. But most of those who succeed do not succeed year after year. Then theres another question. Can anyone figure out who thats going to be in advance?", "tokens": 71, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Thats the really, really hard question. Many investors have chosen to believe that, Oh, yeah, 30% or Ao% of managers will have alpha. But, thats not true. When you take those who have done better, really better over time, and try to find ways to identify them 10 years in advance, thats so hard we might say its impossible. Sullivan: Can you identify characteristics of persistently outperforming managers in advance? Ellis: Well, I will differ from most people in this. For most people, the overwhelming number-one characteristic is brilliance. And Im certainly not opposed to brilliance. Im very much in favor of brilliance. But the characteristic that I would put highest is character. I believe that really good character is your only as aclient defense against being disappointed.", "tokens": 128, "label": "light"}
{"text": "I think of it as similar to becoming a father-in-law. Think of the man your daughter will someday introduce you to by saying, Oh, Dad. I want you meet George. Hes just wonderful.

Will he be a good, loyal, caring, kind, supportive friend to my daughter 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 40 years from now? And for that question, theres only one metric that counts: character. Sullivan: So, successful investing is mostly about character? Ellis: Yes for clients selecting managers. If you go into active investing, you're going into a dangerous line of work. Its very difficult to do. And arrogance is one of the problems that most successful firms have because brilliant people cant help but notice that theyre brilliant. Ive done it!", "tokens": 158, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Nobody else could have done what I did. And they start to take it personally. And brilliant people working together, if they get tarnished with arrogance, find its difficult to work together really well.

Also, they dont give the same kind of supportive critique and evaluation. > Ellis (201.4) Words from the Wise: Charles Ellis 3 Really good character for the organization and for the individuals sets a foundation upon which brilliance can and will be shared. People of great character do not make the same kinds of mistakes that people without good character make. They dont cheat. They dont fib or lie to themselves. They dont say, I'll get by. Nobody will notice. That nobody will notice kind of stuff is really dangerous.", "tokens": 151, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "And when you look back and say, Well what happened to that firm or that firm? They once were so good and then, somehow, they changed and they werent so good. What was it? It was the humanity part, the character part of the firm that actually led them to tear themselves down a little or even tearing themselves apart. Sometimes, though usually not, the firm breaks up very publicly. Sullivan: Lets say you're putting together a due diligence questionnaire and you're trying to ascertain character. How do you come away with a comfort about a firms or someone's character? Is it about governance? Ellis: Well, theres no easy answer to that question.", "tokens": 113, "label": "light"}
{"text": "However, one must recognize that it is really important. So, for example, at Yale we do due diligence on each individual person in an investment management organization. We wouldn't be at all surprised to do 30, 4o, 50 interviews with people who have very good reason to know that firm. If you really want to dig, you can dig. And if you ask tough questions but in a very serious way and people are familiar with the idea that you always ask tough questions, but that you're really trying to understand whats going on you build a reputation or brand franchise that can help a lot. Most organizations dont even start to ask questions about what I think is most important. They mostly ask questions about operations, skills, and records or about gaining business. These are good, serious questions about an organization, but theyre all questions about the management process, not about character. ,. the characteristic that | would put highest is character You mentioned governance.

Yes, sure, you're going to get an articulate, well-rehearsed set of answers for all the questions asked about operations and implementation process. Everybody knows how to do that, but not everybody can give you an enhanced view on governance because most people havent even begun to think about how to articulate how they do governance. As a client, I think its the most important thing. That good governance makes such an enormous difference is, for many, a surprise.", "tokens": 95, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Really good governance is hugely advantageous to any organization and even more advantageous to any organization filled with brilliant people who are doing work thats very difficult, like investment management. At the top end, to be really good at investment management, you have to have brilliant people. They have to be doing something well that nobody else knows how to do.", "tokens": 61, "label": "light"}
{"text": "They have to be doing something thats open to constant refreshment. Its difficult work. Sullivan: It sounds central to what you look for in a manager. Ellis: If you really like governance, you probably have pretty good character. If you dont want strong governance, you probably have something you dont want examined. Words from the Wise: Charles Ellis 4 In investing, there is a governance role for the investment committee of a client organization, and a management role for the investment managers either on staff or outside. If you don't have good governance as the client, youre never going to have a great relationship with an investment manager because you won't be reaching in the right directions or high enough. You won't stimulate and motivate the managers. Ilmanen: Part of that good governance is to have a split between that of the board and its governance role not micromanaging and allowing the asset management staff do their work. Do you feel that way? Ellis: Oh, yes I do, very much. I urge any investment committee | sit on to concentrate on providing good governance and not getting involved in management. As trustees, we dont know enough about the specifics to make any operational decisions because management in investment management is an all day, every day responsibility. It cant be done with three to five meetings per year lasting two to three hours at a time. That may be plenty of time for policy thinking and for evaluating the strength of an organization, but nowhere near enough time to do management. So, it is important to recognize that and stay out of the kitchen. ENDOWMENTS AND FOUNDATIONS Sullivan: How has Yale arrived at what might reasonably be considered a heavy allocation to alternatives? Ellis: Well, as in so many cases, what looks like an organization decision is actually centered around one person and its almost wholly dependent upon that one person. At Yale, its the David Swensen story.", "tokens": 327, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Everybody who knows David knows that he is a delightful person, really smart, and a very nice cuy. But that really underestimates what hes really all about. David was Jim Tobins favorite Ph.D. student. David and Jim had a great personal as well as academic relationship. For example, when it snowed, David would show up at Tobins house to shovel the snow. When David got his Ph.D. he said to Jim, So, what courses am I going to teach? And Jim looked right at him and said, None. And David said, What do you mean?

{"text": "But, youve got to get down to Wall Street and find out what markets are really like. There are two firms that you ought to work with. One is Lehman Brothers and one is Salomon Brothers. And Ive arranged that you could meet with both. Thats how David Swenson came to meet Marty Leibowitz.* While at Salomon, David created the first interest rate swap between IBM and the World Bank. It was a floater for a fixed-rate swap, nobody had ever heard of such a thing. Thats a metric of what David's got in the way of horsepower. Secondly, he really is a marvelous human being.", "tokens": 106, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Its so easy to like and to admire him, and wish you could have more time with him. * Leibowitz with Ilmanen and Sullivan (2015) Words from the Wise: Charles Ellis 5 Third is he has a very clear sense of true north. His family comes out of the academic community in Wisconsin. His mother, after she retired from her normal career, became a Lutheran minister. His brother is one of the senior physicians at the Mayo Clinic. These are people who have some deeply-rooted philosophical values. Bill Brainard, who was then provost at Yale and a member of the Economics Department, called David and asked him to return to Yale; once again to Davids surprise, not to teach, but to manage the endowment.", "tokens": 124, "label": "light"}
{"text": "At that time, it was a $1 billion endowment, very conventionally and not very successfully managed. David started by moving to index funds as a perfectly sensible first approximation and then he worked and developed a competitive advantage of insight and understanding into specific managers. He started thinking about the structure of the overall portfolio and said, You know, Yale has been around for almost 300 years. Its probably going to be around for another 300 years. I've got to learn how to think really long term about investing. Jim Tobin worked out a spending rule for Yales endowment that floats through time in sucha way as to provide inter-generational equity between older and younger groups and smooth spending. Over time, the level of spending was raised because the results were large enough to back it. What David did for the next 29 years was to build a global network of investment management professionals. Everyone knows hes smart and decisive. If you bring him a really good trade idea, he can make a decision in one minute on the telephone. If Yale is considering a new manager, he will be unbelievably intensive in his evaluation of that manager, either himself or members of his team. If Yale were much smaller in assets, it would have to be managed differently. He also has a great way in developing the people on his team. He teaches an undergraduate course in which the best students work for the endowment over the summer. The best of those get a chance to join full time for two or three years. They all take every job he offers them because they know its the best opportunity theyre ever going to have to learn. So hes got the best of the best in terms of talent and horsepower. And hes chosen people who are enjoyable to be with and enjoy being part of the team. Also, if Yale were two or three times as large, they also couldn't do what they're now doing. He has built a scuttlebutt network that is unique, one that anyone would love to be a part of. 'd give anything if I could be helpful to David Swensen. If the President of the United States called and said, Id like to get your advice on something where you could help, you wouldnt say, Well, Im going to be busy that day. No.", "tokens": 400, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "You'd say, Yes sir. Id be thrilled to come. Same sort of thing with David. Thats another reason Yale is so good. Now, theres one other thing. If Yale were much smaller in assets, it would have to be managed differently. If it was $5 billion maybe you could do what he does, but not at $1 billion. Also, if Yale were two or three times as large, they also couldn't do what theyre now doing. Too big. Furthermore, if Yale changed quickly that would be a real problem because everything Yale does requires a gradual approach. It is all done in a way that is right for Yale. It is not quite the Words from the Wise: Charles Ellis 6 right way to manage money for Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Duke or Stanford and so on. It is specifically the right way to manage for Yale, given Yales character. Ilmanen: Why the distinction versus other endowments? Ellis: Well, Yale, for example, is centralized financially; theres a single endowment. Harvard has a separate endowment for Arts and Sciences, the Divinity School, Law School, Business School and so on. Each segment relies on the endowment differently, the percentage coming out of the endowment for Arts and Sciences is very high; close to 50%. They have to think about volatility very differently than, for an example, the School of Education, which sets almost nothing from its little endowment so a lot of volatility is unbelievably doesnt make any real difference. defensive.\" The structure of the portfolio is defensive. The spending rule is defensive. The selection of investment managers Ilmanen: Can you discuss Yale endowments phenomenal record? Ellis: When one looks at the investment record you say, Look at the record. Its terrific. I say wait a minute, you're looking at the rate of return part of the record and | agree with you fully. Its terrific. However, the magic of the Yale investing is that it has always been defensive. Ilmanen: What do you mean by defensive? Ellis: The structure of the portfolio is defensive. The spending rule is defensive. The selection of investment managers is unbelievably defensive. Yes, you want brilliant people. You want people who are doing exciting work and they're highly motivated; and of course, you need character, character, character. Yales investment team digs into the backgrounds and the character of individuals more than anybody Ive ever seen before and digs into the process by which they manage. Whats your compensation process and how could that go wrong? Whats your process of making decisions, and has that changed? Two years ago you didnt do it quite that way.", "tokens": 438, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "What was the reason you made that change? If you look at Yales performance record, they've been moderately better than their peers. Roughly half of that is by having better results per investment manager, and roughly half of it is by having a better asset mix that, in the long run, worked out well. One last thing: When you look at the list of investment managers for Yale, you'll recognize maybe a third of them, and none of them will you know really well. Why is that? Yale is out on the frontier all the time looking for those people who are really unusual. Does that mean a lot of manager turnover? No. The average manager tenure, most of whom started their first day in business with Yale, is around 17 years. Ilmanen: So, we should try to make manager assessments with much more information than simply performance.", "tokens": 148, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Ellis: Absolutely!", "tokens": 2, "label": "light"}
{"text": "And focus on the non-negative. Really strong defense makes the offense easy. Most of the trouble in investment management is not because you came just a little short of having superb investment results. Its because you made a mistake. Knowing how to be selective, you avoid the mistakes. Words from the Wise: Charles Ellis 7 Ilmanen: The financial crisis of 2008 was certainly a challenging environment, what did Yale learn from that experience?

Just about the time you think people don't realize theres never going to be a horrific negative surprise, one comes how much talent, barreling along. I may be too careful. I may be too protective. I may self-discipline, be too defensive. Though knowing history, I think its probably a background pretty good idea. information and networking goes into doing what Yale does.

Meanwhile, if you keep working those extra eight years and keep adding to your 401(k), you also delay taking money out for another eight years.

Because the kids have Words from the Wise: Charles Ellis 10 gone away and you're typically still in pretty good physical shape and don't have health problems, so you don't have those costs and you can benefit from eight years of additional savings.

By the time you get to be an 80-year-old, I can understand it because the result softens on the emotional side and you really dont ever want to do investing such that you might get scared by a negative event, panic, and make a dreadful mistake. Lets go back to the 30-year-old. If a 30-year-old is looking at his or her investment portfolio, I believe that theyre just not looking at the whole picture. Their investment portfolio is relatively tiny. The biggest part of their whole picture is their human capital their intellectual property; their ability to earn income for many years.

So, take a long horizon; only review your portfolio every few years, and all those ups and downs will smooth out.

They then drifted towards 60/40 partly because at that time there was a bull market, and partly because most actuaries were using a 5-year planning horizon in which 60/40 worked out to be optimal. If actuaries instead worked with a 10-year horizon, you would have come out with a different allocation, probably a 75/25 stock-bond mix.

{"text": "Leibowitzs academic training first in physics and later in mathematics provided an important education to succeed at an otherwise daunting task. Earning his bachelors in liberal arts and a masters degree in physics from the University of Chicago, and a Ph.D. from New York University, Dr. Leibowitz spent a quarter-century at Salomon Brothers as a Partner, initially as Head of Fixed Income Research, and ultimately becoming in charge of all research activities at the firm. Dr. Leibowitz then joined TIAA-CREF as Chief Investment Officer and Vice Chairman, and now serves as Managing Director in Equity Research at Morgan Stanley. Over the decades, he has written or coauthored more articles than anyone else in the Financial Analysts Journal and has contributed to numerous books on a wide range of asset management topics. He is one of only two people who have won all three top awards from CFA Institute. Apart from the many industry awards bestowed upon him, Marty consistently appears on the short list of people when other thought-leaders in finance are asked to identify the most important and influential people in the investment profession.

The remaining DB plans have been shifting gradually to liability-driven investing (LDI) for a host of reasons, including: e DB plans grew to be quite large relative to the sponsoring firms market value. e The attraction of reducing contributions by holding equity-oriented portfolios diminished as pension plans funded status became more volatile in the early 2000s. e Changing accounting regulations increased the magnitude and visibility of the sponsoring firms balance sheet volatility. We explore Whats next for DB plans? and the conditions in which increasing or decreasing risk makes the most sense, with provocative insights. We then turn to assessing the observed greater risk-taking by U.S. public pension plans, taking in some lessons from pension models implemented abroad, and asking how best to support a more secure retirement for individual investors. We conclude with Martys thoughts on his research on asset allocation, duration targeting and equity valuations. A fascinating discussion about how Marty came to Wall Street, what he discovered when he arrived there, as well as an exploration of his heroes is included in a special section. Finally, for readers not well versed with the challenges of U.S. DB plans, Appendix A provides some terminology and key concepts as background for the discussion in the next few pages. Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 1 Pension Investing Challenges CORPORATE DEFINED-BENEFIT PLANS Antti IImanen: You are arguably the father of the asset-liability perspective in pension management. The approach has been called various things like asset-liability management (ALM) or liability-driven investing (LDI), but whatever name used, your ideas gave investors the tools in the 1980s for immunization, surplus optimization and more. They attracted institutional attention (and action) but in the 1990s moved to the background as defined-benefit (DB) plans increasingly focused on growing assets, especially via equity-oriented portfolios.", "tokens": 516, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "More recently, ALM has made a comeback. Why was your prescient advice ignored for so long? Marty Leibowitz: I don't think I ever believed that a narrow view of things was the whole story. Every situation is different; the nature of the risks and time horizons that people can stomach dictates an awful lot of the final result. So, to say that youre going to drive down to the point where you minimize your liability risk is, I think, too stark. There are too many other variables that enter into it.", "tokens": 91, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Even back in the 1980s, when we were talking about surplus optimization, we were really noting that, hey, look, if you take a look at the liabilities and youre concerned with how to manage the surplus, there are ways to likely improve the situation. We never really intended for immunization to be the total advice or endpoint for an institution, but a starting point, really, which I think is helpful , even if its not the final solution. We tried to promote a combined perspective. * Ilmanen: Some people are more pure-minded about the need to immunize liabilities. Leibowitz: Yes, Stan Kogelman and I had some huge debates with Larry Bader on this topic. Larry is a brilliant actuary with a photographic memory, so you cant win an argument against him. I learned a lot from Larry, but never convinced him. I guess I should pride myself on having the prescience to bring an actuary and an accountant into Salomon Brothers bond research group. Larry is an actuarys actuary. Rodney Sullivan: One issue we'd like to discuss is why the asset-liability perspective was not more influential in 1990s and why corporate DB plans seem more inclined to pursue it now. Leibowitz: Thats an interesting case, because its not clear that plan sponsors have all of a sudden gone back and read all the literature, seen what Fischer Black, Irwin Tepper? or Larry Bader* had to say about it that a pension fund should invest all in fixed income, because it was tax free, and then take the equity risk in the corporate structure. Clearly some broader forces have been in play.", "tokens": 271, "label": "medium"}

See, for example, Black (1980) See, for example, Tepper (1981) See, for example, Bader and Gold (2007) Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 2 Ilmanen: One broad trend has been the shift from DB plans to DC plans. The growing interest in LDI and various forms of de-risking in remaining DB plans seems related. Do both trends reflect waning willingness by corporate sponsors to underwrite pension related risks?", "tokens": 76, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Leibowitz: Well, corporate DB plans are slowly becoming extinct going the way of the dinosaur. The world is turning to DC, certainly in corporate America, and amazingly, globally according to Roger Urwins stats with DC defined in a flexible fashion. Behaviorally, I think corporations are eager to shed that liability, no matter what. This is understandable, given how the market and investors view those liabilities and the potential impact on earnings, the associated cost of deficits and so on. I think while corporate senior executives want to move toward minimizing the impact of plan fluctuations and to move toward ultimately unloading their DB plans, they also dont necessarily want to incur excessive costs, by doing it at times when it seems unwise, especially when viewed in hindsight. Corporations look at interest rates these days as being low, and how can you argue with them? And they see that if interest rates rose to a level where they seem reasonable, and their deficits were low and tolerable, they would then likely try to immunize their plans. Ilmanen: Some critics ask why such a transition was not done, say 10 to 15 years ago, when interest rate levels were higher. We just discussed the related trend to close DB plans. When DB plans were open to new enrollment, there was a stronger case for holding equities to support associated future wage growth. Was another reason for the change in attitudes that pension plans crew So large relative to their sponsoring companies? Leibowitz: Yes, thats a biggie. The game has changed over the last 50 years. Theres been a huge increase in financial assets, far greater than the growth of GDP. The typical corporate pension fund used to be a peanut compared to where it was going to be and compared to the sponsoring organizations market value. So, that changed a lot of the game, legitimately, as it is now at the point where the pension sometimes dominates the corporate capital structure. This means that the level of risk thats appropriate for the plan is actually quite different now. Managing a pension fund in an environment where its such a huge presence in your corporate life is different than when it was a sidebar. Ilmanen: So the tradeoff between reducing expected contributions and pension-related risks became less attractive merely because the plans grew larger and those risks less affordable. Some say that the tail began to wag the dog here. I guess a related game changer must be the accounting change (FASB158 in 2006) which required showing market-based valuation of the funded status on the corporate balance sheet by using the corporate bond yield as the discount rate for liabilities. Leibowitz: Yes, its more onerous to have deficits when the funded status is more visible on the balance sheet. The stock market takes note of it in the corporations stock price. And the balance sheet volatility may be intolerable, given the huge fluctuations in funding ratios over the last 15 years Or So. Sullivan: Large corporate DB plans shifted from being overfunded (123% funding ratio) in 2000 based on the Milliman 100 index to underfunded (82%) in 2002, largely due to falling equity See Towers Watson, Global Pensions Assets Study, (2014) Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 3 markets and bond yields, as the latter boosted liability values. The rollercoaster continued in 2008 when the typical funding ratio fell from 105% to 79%. Leibowitz: And it wasnt just adverse developments in capital markets. Pension obligations have also grown because of rising longevity and increasing pension insurance costs. In addition, the Pension Protection Act (PPA) of 2006 based minimum contributions of underfunded plans on corporate bond yields. The impact so far has been lessened because later legislation has allowed some smoothing of those discount rates. Ilmanen: I have also heard it said that corporations can no longer extract plan surpluses but yet are responsible for any deficits, making pension plans adversely asymmetric. Leibowitz: There was more flexibility years ago where plans could actually take back surplus cash from the plan. Then, there were some arrangements where they could transfer from a surplus in one plan to another pension plan or a VEBA (voluntary employees beneficiary association) type of retiree health plan. So, there were various ways of extracting, which became I think ever more constrained in ever more complex ways. Currently, I believe the way to think about it is that a surplus only benefits a corporation in that it allows a contribution holiday. So the returns to a corporation have indeed become more asymmetric. Sullivan: We can try to summarize the descriptive case why corporations have shifted from equity- oriented DB portfolios toward bond-oriented portfolios. The key elements seem to be the broad DB-to-DC trend (declining sponsorship); growing size of pension plans (making it more risky for sponsors to hold large equity positions to reduce expected contributions); and finally capital market developments and accounting changes (the larger and more visible fluctuations in the funded status). Ilmanen: Lets now turn from descriptive to normative and consider some advice for today on best practices. There are many nuances, of course, but the big-picture question is: Under what conditions should corporate DB plans stick with the equity-oriented portfolio and when should they consider LDI? Lets start with the case of a fully funded corporate DB plan, without a willing sponsor to keep the plan open, and normal market conditions. Does de-risking make sense here? Leibowitz: Yes.", "tokens": 910, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "I believe it does. Ilmanen: OK, then lets explore the harder case, which is most relevant today: a DB plan that is underfunded at a 80% to 90% funding ratio. Is it a good idea to try to grow out of that deficit, as is the conventional wisdom? Or should one de-risk and immunize to prevent even larger losses, which inevitably require sponsor contributions. Leibowitz: This can be argued in many ways.", "tokens": 72, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Lets use the analogue of an individual who is facing retirement. You can only fund yourself at 80% to 90% of the lifestyle you desire at retirement. Do you take risks and how much risk?", "tokens": 35, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Well, if youre at 90%, at least its viable and you have some degrees of freedom, I would think. If you found yourself deteriorating down to 80%, its extraordinarily painful. So, yes, you might want to de-risk at that 90% point. Ehrhardt, Wadia, and Perry (2014) Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 4", "tokens": 53, "label": "light"}
{"text": "On the other hand, if you find that you're at 90% funding ratio of whats a fairly comfortable lifestyle and you feel that you have some degrees of lifestyle freedom, and a future surplus would be nice (if not absolutely necessary), then you may want to remain in risky assets to garner more return. So, these issues are all over the place, but to grow your way out of a situation, which would be desperate if you lose money, would not be the analog I would give a corporation. With a closed fund, with people who are desperately depending upon it, I think that in some ways de-risking might be the answer, even at a deficit. On the other hand, with an open fund, given some willingness of the corporation to sponsor downside risks, or even with a closed fund but with the presence of some other back-up, the case for growing out instead of paying up now is appealing for the sponsor. Ilmanen: Yes, that makes sense.", "tokens": 168, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "There is tension between the desire to grow out of the hole and the fear of getting deeper into it. You sympathized earlier with investor concerns regarding the low starting yields. Does your de-risking advice vary with the yield level? Leibowitz: Let me just say: You're asking questions which lead to complex answers. Why cant you ask me a yes or no question!? (laughter) Even the issue of de-risking is not simple, because de-risking is thought of as LDI. De-risking in some situations may mean go to cash; just take your risk assets off the table entirely. So, here you are, you ve got a closed plan or you are an individual and you're at the 80% funding level. Youre really worried, but you also think interest rates are quite low. That view might push you to either move everything to cash with the hope of investing in long bonds later at higher rates. Ilmanen: Id just say that any timing decision where one puts the whole portfolio into cash would be hard to sustain unless one is incredibly skillful or lucky with that timing decision.", "tokens": 186, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Leibowitz: Let me rephrase it this way. Suppose you have a neutral view on the future of interest rates and interest rates are high enough so that they could decline enough so that you really would find yourself in a worse funding situation. Then the case for de-risking would be stronger than it is today with the near-record-low yields. Ilmanen: So, you suggest delaying de-risking in an abnormal interest rate environment, which is a valuation-sensitive and view-driven perspective. This is indeed the common glide path adopted by many U.S. pension plans to commit themselves to de-risking but only once market conditions and funding ratios improve. It reminds me of the youthful St.", "tokens": 112, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Augustines prayer to become chaste but not quite yet. But to be clear, you would say that in normal conditions, an underfunded plan should just in some way bite the bullet because trying to grow out of your hole involves an even worse downside scenario, and thats a bigger consideration? Leibowitz: Underfunded AND with no backup support, yes. Given all those conditions we discussed. Then yes. Ilmanen: Lets expand on your no backup comment. Maybe one thing that is different today versus 10 or 20 years ago, is that a corporation once had the willingness to be the backup? Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 5 Leibowitz: Thats a good point, because the willingness is both a cultural thing and a size thing, because as we were talking about earlier, the level of anteing up that youd have to do now would really hurt.", "tokens": 144, "label": "light"}
{"text": "In the past it was relatively smaller. So, why not? If you've got a really rich uncle, you may take more risks as an individual. The larger size of the pension plans today means that many firms are less able or willing to underwrite further contributions when needed. Dont we all wish we had a bailout uncle? PUBLIC DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Ilmanen: Lets now turn to other pension investor types. An even larger group of DB plans are, of course, the U.S. public plans, which mostly remain open. To what extent does your advice to public plans differ from the above? Can public plans maintain their higher risk profile, despite having even lower funding ratios than corporate plans?", "tokens": 118, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Leibowitz: Public plans are quite complicated, and I don't pretend to fully understand how the situation plays out from this point in time. Its clear that in many cases, at least at the first order, that these benefits are guaranteed by the government, the local government. On the other hand, its also clear that if the local government finds itself in dire straits, that there can be issues, especially on various forms of the liabilities. So, if you take one extreme and say the taxing power of a governmental entity is unlimited, without any kind of consequences, and the liabilities are guaranteed by that taxing power, then I would say that taking appropriate risk, in terms of garnering more return over the long term, makes sense. A long investment horizon is often presumed to allow this more aggressive risk- taking and even the use of a higher discount rate related to long-run expected asset returns. The problem is of course, as we've seen, those assumptions can be called into question in the extremes.", "tokens": 173, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Its interesting. Go back and ask even a more basic question. Why should we even have trust funds in the first place? Why not just be a pay-as-you-go plan? Ilmanen: And some do. Leibowitz: Yes. In fact, thats the way it used to be. And in fact, in that model we've just described infinite taxing power, guaranteed payouts why would you need any funding at all? The answer to that is pretty clear, because the assumptions involved in pay-as-you-go are just that: assumptions! People dont necessarily have comfort in those assumptions, and you cant even know exactly where you stand in terms of the cost or anything without having something akin toa trust fund. So, the problems with the model, which are really quite complex, create the need for a trust fund. Ilmanen: So the long horizon and taxing powers as a back-up enable greater risk-taking for public plans. Unlike corporate plans, I dont see anybody really pushing public plans to de-risk in this environment. Leibowitz: In theory, one might argue that higher funding ratios SHOULD allow for greater risk- taking.

{"text": "different levels of a funding ratio, ve found that there are two opposite reactions to large deficits. One can go to asset preservation mode and protect some floor level of wealth, or one may embrace risks and roll the dice. This also applies to individuals in comparable situations. Turning to a happier positive-surplus situation, one finds that some individuals may adopt an attitude of why take a risk 1 dont need, and move into some form of personal de-risking. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT PLANNING Ilmanen: This is a nice segue to asking what our industry can do to support a more secure retirement for individuals. Are DC plans and target date funds the best way forward? Or is there something better?", "tokens": 119, "label": "light"}

Individuals associations are becoming more tenuous, in terms of how much time they'll spend employed by any one corporation people are not career players with corporations these days. So, employees may prefer a DC plan IF the contribution rates are sufficiently high, IF there is a good range of investment options, IF the net fees are reasonable, IF they vest pretty quickly, IF there is an economically viable annuity option, etc. Yet, I have concerns about DC plans, 401(k)s. As many benefits and virtues that they have, they have some real downsides which are underappreciated. And DB plans have great virtues, for society. Target date funds are a move in the right direction. The question about what the target dates are and how they should apply to everybody in the same situation, I think are open questions. I think the bigger issue is: Are contribution rates sufficient given reasonable prospective returns and risk levels of the funds, to provide the level of after-tax annuities or after-tax payouts that people really need to maintain their desired lifestyle?", "tokens": 197, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Sadly, I think the answer is, for a whole bunch of reasons, no. Now, TIAA-CREF [where Marty was the Vice Chairman between 1995 and 2004] for some reasons which were happenstance and some which were just very, very purposeful has turned out to be a magnificent DC plan, in my opinion. But a lot of those characteristics arent always the same in the corporate world, starting with contribution levels and longevity of the plan. And it was nice to be a long-term investor over, maybe not the 1970s, but the 1980s and the 1990s and the 2000s. In some ways, we earned returns which were better than we had any reason to expect. Ilmanen: Arguably, to some extent, the unexpected high returns that the current generation experienced may be taken from the next generation via the current low expected returns for fixed income and some correction of the capital gains windfall we enjoyed. Perhaps either the slow pain of long-term low-return persistence, or the fast pain of a correction. Leibowitz: Thats a further sobering thought, among many sobering thoughts.

{"text": "TIAA-CREF also received a high basic employer contribution rate of 9% from the universities.

This is where it gets really amazingly prescient, because Carnegie went on to say that if professors cant afford to retire, then new blood and new ideas cannot come into the educational system.

Its very tough for those organizations lacking a broad pool of participants. Ilmanen: Besides Aussies, the Dutch pension plans are often seen as models for other countries. They really think hard about these issues in the Netherlands. Leibowitz: Well, the Dutch pension funds are a very, very interesting study. I have great admiration for the way they think about things.

Leibowitz: Yes, and funding!", "tokens": 168, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Ilmanen: Yes, and funding. Being overfunded allows them to follow the classic ALM prescription of reducing risk as the funding ratio falls toward 100, choosing not to take a high level of risks lest they might become underfunded. In contrast, the typical glide path for U.S. corporate plans involves reducing risk as the funding ratio rises from 80 toward 100. Leibowitz: Another point is that I believe the U.S. is the only country in the world where the general norm for corporate pension funds is nominal dollar liabilities. Just think about the ramifications of that. In the Netherlands, with the greatest pension reserves per capita in the world, they found that they could not continue to provide full inflation protection. Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 8 Nominal liability plans as used in the U.S. have huge implications for society. With retirement horizons now lengthening to 20 and 30 years and beyond, even low levels of inflation can inflict severe damage to the real income derived from either a DC plan or a nominal dollar DB plan. RECENT RESEARCH: ASSET ALLOCATION Sullivan: We'd like to now change gears and discuss some of your research in recent years. We might start with asset allocation topics. In your 2014 paper on risk functions, or generalized funding ratios, you suggest that investors tend to migrate to one of two portfolios; one with a beta of 0.6, which would be a 60 equities/40 bonds type of portfolio, or to one of very low-risk with a beta of around 0.2. Why these two groups?", "tokens": 259, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Leibowitz: Well, there are two answers to that. There are certain types of institutional investors that are driven by their liabilities, or by their regulatory charter, to essentially be bond investors: like insurance companies. They dont get to choose their beta. The burning bush gives it to them. Sullivan: These are the 0.2 beta investors?", "tokens": 55, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Leibowitz: Yes. And the really intriguing result is that most institutional portfolios, apart from these regulatory-constrained portfolios, have a beta of 0.6, although that may be changing currently. Some research we did at TIAA-CREE led me to show that most variants of real-world allocations consistently had equity betas near 0.6. We found that equity risk dominates diversified portfolios, even in normal times, and that they basically have the beta sensitivity of a 60/40 portfolio, no matter their composition, which was astonishing to me and to a lot of people. Its not the dominance of equity risk that is so surprising, its the fact that so many institutional portfolios endowment, sovereign wealth, foundation, pre-LDI pension plan map into a 60/40 portfolio risk profile. Sullivan: What are some of the practical implications? Leibowitz: Once you have a model, you can employ intuition and start putting questions and answers into that framework. So, I began thinking about the implications for the individual investor, because I always found the individual investors problems more challenging. For instance, they dont have infinite time horizons like many institutional investors say they do, nor various degrees of sponsor backup if things go poorly. So, the first benefit that comes out of this research is a better understanding of how people might approach retirement. They have to, or most should, go to lower-risk portfolios as they enter retirement. That idea has been around for many years and is widely applied in life-cycle funds. The prevalence of the 60/40 model means, of course, that equity market beta is indeed the dominant source of risk, just like the theory says. It also means that to the extent that you can find ways of generating returns which are uncorrelated with that portfolio, those are really good 8 Leibowitz and Bova (2014) Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 9 returns, those are the ultimate alpha. It was these findings that eventually led to the Endowment Model book. Sullivan: Are there other implications? Leibowitz: Another observation is that there are some institutions that basically live off their existing endowment to a very large extent and cannot incur any risk because they dont have any backup or sponsor to bail them out if things dont go well. They dont have a flexible spending plan. I happen to be involved with an academic institute that employs this low-beta approach.", "tokens": 393, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "The mantra here is to maintain a low beta, because we cant take the risk of a high-beta event. So, clearly, there are some institutions for whom this low-beta approach may make sense. However, if someone came down from Mars and looked at the range of allocations of various institutions in this world they would undoubtedly ask, Why do all these institutions that have very different situations, different spending plans, different backup sponsors, different investment capabilities all have roughly the same risk level? It doesnt make sense! This Martian paradox prompted me to try to understand if there is something meaningful, something deep here, in terms of how the risk level is determined in various situations. This exploration led to the Generalized Funding Ratio paper.* IlImanen: One question we have recently been exploring is when did the 60/40 model become so popular? There seems to have been a big transition sometime in 1960s-70s that many institutions moved to 60/40 orientations? And why has it stuck? Leibowitz: Going way back, how were pension funds managed?

Bank Administration Institute (1968) Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 10 As pension plans became sizable, there was a limit to what kind of negative event plans could tolerate. Some of the reasons were more behavioral than economic, as to what the sponsors were willing to tolerate. I think that people would push their equity or risk percentage up to the point where they reached the limit of potential pain. It was not a formal optimization. If you think about it, sponsors want to have a sufficiently low probability of a negative 20% event within a reasonable career span. This takes you to a 60/40 portfolio. We wrote a paper called Convergence of Risks,** where we looked at three types of risks that people would want to avoid: a within-one-year loss, an over-three-year decline below initial value, and a drawdown risk. And we assigned various probabilities of these things and we just took standard numbers and simple normal! distributions. And it turned out that a lot of these different types of risks converged to being within shortfall bounds for a 60/40 portfolio basis. Ilmanen: So you think these painful worst-case scenarios influence institutional asset-class allocations? Leibowitz: Yes, and not just 60/40.

Strategic optimization model output with standard data input would have maybe zero fixed income, lots of real estate, lots of commodities, lots of emerging market equity. End of story, and yet nobody does it. RECENT RESEARCH: DURATION TARGETING Sullivan: Lets turn now to your recent research on duration targeting. Earlier, you alluded to your research into returns to bonds and the relationship to starting yields and what you call duration targeting. What is duration targeting? Leibowitz: Duration targeting is a term that Stan Kogelman and I coined in the early 1990s along with my colleague Terry Langetieg. We found that, as bond managers became more performance oriented, they tended to rebalance toward a duration target, instead of holding to maturity as they had done in the past. We started looking into what duration targeting meant for the return pattern of bonds through simulations. Terry, who led the work on this, found that, curiously, there was a time in the future where the variability of annualized returns on a portfolio of bonds was minimized. In the course of this project, Terry was diagnosed as having an aggressive and inoperable brain tumor. Terry told us that, during this terrible period, pushing forward on this project helped to 12 | eibowitz and Bova (2005) Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 11 give him some moments of respite and even joy. The results were published in the FAJ and we rushed to get a copy of that issue to Terrys home before it was too late.

{"text": "Leibowitz: I picked up this idea again recently due to a request by Bill Falloon at Wiley to think about writing a new version of Inside the Yield Book.\"* So, Stan, Anthony and I started looking at how trend lines would relate to duration targeting. This is where it gets interesting. What we pretty clearly found was that with a simple trend line process with fixed annual moves in rates for any period of time, the early price depreciations accumulate at a certain linear pace, while the accruals start slowly but then accumulate at a more quadratic pace. The quadratic pace ultimately overcomes the linear pace, so that returns converge back to the starting yield. Most astonishing is that it doesnt matter how big the annual rate moves are. We started with the Treasury index, which for a long time was quite stable at around years. So, we had a great testing ground for duration targeting. We explored the question Does the return converge to the starting yield over a prescribed period of time? Ilmanen: You found that you earn roughly the average starting yield? Leibowitz: Yes, but over six years, instead of the nine we expected. There are important reasons why the returns converge sooner than we expected. This was also in the course of a wonderful bull market, a huge trend downward in yields. In such a bull market for bonds, one might have expected ever better returns over time. But it turned out that that returns converged around the yield at the start of the investment horizon.

{"text": "Ilmanen: Some people have more of those than others. Leibowitz: For example, consider the impact of a yield curve that creates what we call rolling yields. We knew that the rolling yield should theoretically be the convergence target, given a stable yield curve shape. So, we sought to test it further; we wanted a data set where the shape of the yield curve did not change that much. And bingo, municipal bonds. We found the same empirical result as well as many interesting relations between ladder portfolios (common in the muni market), rolling yields and forward rates. This work will soon appear in a FAJ article. Ilmanen: So, one key result in your return convergence studies is that trend wise changing yields do not have too much of an impact on multiyear returns of duration-targeted portfolios. Is this similar to the old immunization literature, where price effect (capital losses) and reinvestment effect offset each other? Leibowitz: The principles are definitely connected.

Words from the Wise: Marty Leibowitz 12 Ilmanen: In the current environment of low yields, does this suggest we do not need to worry quite as much about rising yields, given that there are some cushioning effects. There is the steep yield curve giving a rolling yield benefit, and should yields rise gradually, there are capital losses but these can be offset by accrual or reinvestment effects. Leibowitz: Yes. However, there are always two sides to every coin. For a long-term investor, if you can stomach the short-term effects of what might be higher yields and price deterioration, then you can have some assurance that your return will come back over time to your original yield. If on the other hand, you think theres a high probability that rates are more likely to go up than down in the near term, that doesnt mean you should just sit on your convergence prospects. RECENT RESEARCH: EQUITY VALUATIONS AND REAL YIELD LEVEL Ilmanen: Finally, we'd like to discuss your so-called tent pattern* that relates equity market valuations and real bond yield levels. You show that equity markets have historically achieved high price/earnings ratios (P/E) in some sweet spot environment of moderately positive real bond yields, and have lower P/Es at the times of both very high and very low real yields. Do you think that relationship applies today?", "tokens": 407, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "Leibowitz: Not without qualification, because I think having super active central bankers changes the equation. In the past, very low real rates used to coincide with poor economic conditions. You now have very low rates driven by a central banking system seemingly determined to try to generate growth and to avoid financial debacles. They are having some success at least in asset markets so the relation between low rates and bad economic environments is now more tenuous. I think that helps explain a little bit why you have much higher P/Es in this environment now than you had historically. Ilmanen: Good point. Leibowitz: The tent analysis was a combination of some empirical and some theoretical analysis. First, it was the empirical results that surprised me, but we could then tell a theoretical story to explain it. We saw the pattern of low P/Es in 1970s amid high rates, followed by the falling rates and rising valuations in 1980s and 90s. Subsequently, my colleague at Morgan Stanley, Adam Parker, carried this analysis back to the 1930s, and he found the same tent pattern. So, that was pretty astonishing to us. As a theoretical story, if low interest rates were associated with lousy economic prospects, then it would make sense that the risk premiums for equities would be sufficiently high so as to depress their valuations, and depressed valuations would be appropriate in that environment.

{"text": "e Sponsor firms have increasingly stopped offering DB plans to new employees, instead offering defined-contribution (DC) plans, where the investment and longevity risks belong to the employee. In existing DB plans, some sponsors have frozen the plan (stopping the growth of liabilities with wages), de-risked using liability-driven investing (LDI), and in extreme cases terminated the plan. e The post-retirement benefits in corporate DB plans are typically defined in nominal terms so the main liability is nominal (for mature or frozen plans) but during the working years the liability is also related to inflation and real wage growth. e The most important measure of pension liabilities is the projected benefit obligations (PBO), which includes both accumulated obligations and projections related to future wage growth and longevity assumptions. The PBO is present-valued using a discount rate which was traditionally tied to actuarial assumptions on the expected return of assets, but which for single-employer corporate plans became tied to long-dated corporate bond yields since 2006. There are many discount rates used for different purposes: (i) for calculating minimum pension contributions some smoothing is allowed (PPA 2006, MAP-21 2012, HATFA 2014) which has enabled the use of discount rates above market yields and thus lower contributions; (ii) for calculating the value of pension surplus or deficit on the corporate balance sheet, no smoothing has been allowed since accounting changes adopted in 2006 (FASB 158). e Pension assets reflect the market value of its holdings whose size reflects employer contributions over time as well as investment returns earned on them. The difference between assets and liabilities is called the funded status (surplus or deficit), or if expressed as a ratio of A/L, it is called the funding ratio (FR) overfunded / fully funded / underfunded if FR is >/=/< 100. If a plan becomes underfunded, the sponsor is required to cover it by making further contributions over a multi-year period.", "tokens": 315, "label": "medium"}

Indeed, the tradeoff between risk and return is central to Modern Portfolio Theory, and risk plays a crucial role in valuing share prices and option prices, among other financial instruments. Risk estimates also have broad implications for the macroeconomy, for instance in estimating systemic risk associated with financial crises, monetary policy, inflation, and so on. As we know well, economic and market risk can vary dramatically over time, fluctuating between calm periods and turbulent periods. In this interview, we discuss with Nobel Laureate Rob Engle his breakthrough research on analyzing economic time series with time-varying volatility. He explains his concept of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and its generalizations and how they have become indispensable tools for both researchers and investors in the statistical modeling of time-varying volatility. Here, he discusses using ARCH-type models in estimating volatility and returns in the short-term and long-term as well as their limitations in doing so. Along the way, we hear about his favorite variation of ARCH used in such applications. We then delve into the underlying drivers of risk and the interesting inverse relationship between risk and returns. The conversation then turns to a discussion on how volatility estimation has important applications to risk management and options pricing and how the Volatility Laboratory, or V-Lab, which was created at NYU Stern School of Business under the direction of Dr. Engle, has grown since its inception from a rather basic laboratory for studying volatility to a highly sophisticated systemic risk measurement and monitoring tool for the global economy. We then hear from Dr. Engle how receiving the Nobel Prize changed his life and how he maintains a healthy work-life balance, something he believes is very important to ensuring a high quality of life. We conclude by learning about his biggest regret and his mentors and heroes.

{"text": "Sullivan: Youve mentioned the scientific method and how this relates to theory and models building on prior results. How does your work in risk and volatility build on the work of Markowitz* and others that laid the initial foundations for the theory of finance? Engle: Well, those models certainly motivated my research. In fact when I looked at these early models, I said, Volatility's assumed constant, yet when I measure it I get lots of different answers at different times. So, really, what I've done is to take the big themes of finance the biggest being the tradeoff between risk and return and ask, How do you build on these models in order to better incorporate volatility? Success requires ways of measuring risk that's not just constant. If risk is time-varying, then we need models that are also time-varying, and that was my contribution. Ilmanen: Moving from the theory to practice, can you discuss why investors find, for instance, your ARCH model so useful? Engle: Well, if you want to measure risk, then you have to have some tools to say where it is now and what it might be in the future. For instance, if you think there is a risk premium associated with volatility, which we all think must be true, then you have to be able to forecast it to some degree.", "tokens": 225, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "If you can't forecast it, how can you possibly charge a premium to people to take this risk? So while I don't think that individual investors are ever going to be running ARCH models to look at their portfolios, I do think institutional investors are all managing risk in very sophisticated ways, using models that have been improved greatly since the ARCH model. This is a natural direction, especially given how hard it is to measure expected returns. It means that volatility is particularly useful in investment management. Ilmanen: Can you discuss for our readers what ARCH, and more broadly, the whole family of ARCH related models, means for estimating volatility?", "tokens": 111, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Engle: Well, ARCH is an acronym which stands for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity. In brief, it is a method that seeks to forecast what the volatility of some particular time series would be, using only the past of that same time series. What it observes is that high volatility that is, large moves in either direction tends to predict that future volatility will continue to be high. So whenever the stock market has a big move whether it's up or down there is a better-than-average chance that it's going to have a big move the next day. It might be in the same direction or it might be in the opposite direction. We call this volatility clustering in the data. Pedersen: What does it say about mean reversion? Engle: The first thing you see is the clustering. Then over longer periods, you find that when the cluster ends, the data mean tends to revert back to some long-term average level. The cluster might be one of low volatility, and that lasts for a while and then it ends, and the volatility goes back up again and reverts back to the average. Thats the prediction from these ARCH-type models. It says if volatility is high today, it's likely to be high tomorrow. But if you go further out in time, it's probably going to go back down toward normal times.", "tokens": 228, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "' For more, see Words from the Wise: Harry Markowitz on Portfolio Theory and Practice (2016). Words From the Wise: Robert Engle 2 I think that this is the most useful aspect of the ARCH model; that it's possible to calibrate it just by using the past series and treat it as an econometric problem, so that if you have a better idea of what the model ought to look like, you can revise it as needed. Sullivan: On the flip side, what are the limitations of an ARCH framework? Engle: Well, first of all, it assumes that the dynamic time shape of the volatility clusters and that the mean reversion is relatively stable over time.", "tokens": 116, "label": "light"}
{"text": "I think thats a reasonable reflection of what we see in the real world. This class of models typically uses only information on the past returns of the same series. So, although it uses only a limited information set, for instance, it doesnt look at other asset classes, it does amazingly well in predicting volatility. We find that it's hard to make a model much better by bringing in other information, because the other information is hard to use. Of course, there are other ways to forecast volatility, for instance there are implied volatility models used by options traders. We have compared these implied volatility forecasts with ARCH volatility forecasts, and find that the implied volatility forecasts typically have more information in them, but they also have some inherent biases. So I think the most important limitation of the ARCH models is they lack full information. Ilmanen: A main empirical result of implied volatility forecasts is that they tend to be biased? Engle: There is an enormous literature on this, and it's very confusing because it comes up with lots of different answers, and I think that the different answers are more related to the methodology of evaluation than to the actual models and methods used. My reading is that if you could do a good, statistically sound, head-to-head comparison between implied volatility and a GARCH (adding a G for generalized) model, maybe over a very short forecast horizon, you'd find the GARCH model was better. But for intermediate terms, the implied volatility model is better. So, even though implied volatility has biases, it just has more information in it. Pedersen: Yes, the implied volatility models seem remarkably informative. Ilmanen: Yes, for example, they can embed information about upcoming earnings announcement dates and other eventful information such as highly volatile days. Engle: Yes, those could be incorporated, but it's complicated to incorporate them into a GARCH model. You have to be able to identify some events in the past that you think are going to be like the ones in the future so that you can model them, whereas an options trader doesn't have to do that.", "tokens": 357, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Ilmanen: The ARCH family of models is a big family, do you have a favorite among them? Engle: It is indeed a big family, and it's getting bigger all the time. My colleague Tim Bollerslev has a glossary of ARCH-style models which has some 50 entries. More importantly, I think that's a lot like naming regression models, which we no longer try to do. For instance, each time you have a new dataset, you might have a different set of regressors in a regression model, and we don't really need to name these models. What we're looking for is the best predictor, and besides we use the same type of likelihood function almost all the time. Some of these predictors are high- frequency predictors and some are low-frequency predictors, and we might have univariate predictors and multivariate predictors. It's an open class of models, so there are always going to be more, but you just don't bother naming them anymore. Ilmanen: Broadly speaking then, do you have a favorite? Engle: The model that I use most often is what is typically called the GJR model, or the Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993) model. It's a model which allows for asymmetry, and so it incorporates the fact that negative returns typically have more predictability for future volatility than positive returns. The EGARCH model is very close to that in terms of its performance and fit. | think there are some cases where one is a little better than the other.", "tokens": 249, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "It's not a big difference. Words From the Wise: Robert Engle 3 Ilmanen: Are you applying this to equities? Engle: Yes, I'm answering this particularly for equities, but in our V-Lab, we apply this to lots of asset classes. And even in asset classes where you don't expect any asymmetry, you tend to find it in the data. Take interest rates and exchange rates, for example, which often have some asymmetry in the volatility. Ilmanen: How about for longer horizon forecasts?", "tokens": 81, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Engle: Another point that I think I should mention in terms of the weaknesses of ARCH models is that they're not particularly good for long-term forecasts. They tend to look a lot like longer-term implied volatilities in that they mean revert fairly systematically for longer horizons.", "tokens": 46, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Also, the path of mean reversion is not all that informative. So you might ask, are there other ways to forecast long-run volatilities? Well, I think it's much more likely that you can make progress by building a structural model of what's really going on in, say, this sector or this economy or whatever. But I think a simple univariate volatility model like EGARCH is not likely to have that kind of information in it. Ilmanen: Can we say anything about the underlying fundamental reasons for the observed large time variation in volatility? Engle: The gold standard for volatility is to understand the economics of why volatility is whatever it is. My favorite interpretation is that the primary driver of volatility is a response of the markets to new information. How fast the news comes in and how important the news is on any particular asset or asset class. So its the news process itself thats fundamentally driving volatility. So when we measure volatility, I think we're really measuring the intensity of the news flow. Sullivan: So then we need to better understand what drives the intensity of the news flow? Engle: Yes, although I and a few others are looking at this, we haven't done nearly enough work on it. Our work was focused on a cross-country model which looked at what makes the financial markets in one country more volatile than another, and we came up with some interesting macroeconomic findings. We found that when inflation is high, volatility tends to be high, and when the economy is slow, volatility again tends to be higher. When the economy is more volatile that is, one quarter it goes up, and the next quarter it goes down financial markets are more volatile. We also found that when interest rates jump around, the equity market is more volatile. So there are some fairly natural, intuitive connections between the macroeconomy and volatility and it's nice to be able to make a quantitative connection.", "tokens": 331, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Pedersen: Has there been any research that attempts to link news flow, say from newspapers articles, to volatility in prices? Engle: We (Engle, Hansen, Lunde (2012)) have been working on that for a couple of years now. Our paper counts news stories or words in news stories that include a ticker, and analyzes whether that helps explain the volatility in prices. The answer is yes, but of course, it's hard to know for sure whether the news stories are reporting the volatility or whether they're causing it. But the interesting thing about it is that the news stories affect volatility not only on the day they're reported, but also several days after that. So it seems like the full information in the news story is not immediately incorporated in the volatility. There's some dynamic that is going on in the markets, which maybe is price discovery, although often we don't think price discovery takes quite that long. So I think there's some interesting things to be said there, and there are a lot of people looking at textual analysis in news stories and so forth. But mostly, they're trying to predict the market return, not the market volatility. Ilmanen: Some get this idea in the wrong direction, that traders cause volatility. Words From the Wise: Robert Engle 4 Engle: That's right. Many believe that the volatility is just something that's manufactured by a lot of beliefs and whatever is currently going on in the marketplace. I think that once you've connected market volatility with news and information, its much easier for typical investors to understand why markets are so volatile. If Janet Yellen says they're unlikely to raise interest rates and the market goes up, well, theres a good story there that makes sense. Sullivan: Fischer Black reportedly said that as markets become more efficient, they become more volatile.", "tokens": 309, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Do you agree with that? I take it that he meant that as news arrives, it's being incorporated more rapidly into market prices thus making markets more volatile. Engle: I very much respect Fischer's opinion on anything, including this, but I have a different opinion. I think at least the speed at which information is received in the markets doesn't really affect the daily volatility as measured end-of-day. It may affect which trader gets to capitalize on this volatility and make money on it. But the fact that you see the price move within 10 seconds of a news announcement versus two hours is not going to show up in end-of-the-day volatility. It might show up if you measure second-by-second volatility. But I don't really think it changes where the markets go from day to day. It might be that price discovery takes three days, in which case day-to-day volatility has changed. But my view is that price discovery probably is on a pretty high-frequency basis, especially now when trading is on such a high-frequency basis. So I don't think that the speed of news shows up very much in the way we measure daily volatility. And after all, it does not seem that the trend of market volatility is generically rising.", "tokens": 212, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Of course it went up during the financial crisis, but then it came back down again. So I don't see any secular drift in volatility, which is what you'd expect if the speed of information drove volatility. Ilmanen: Black may have meant that in markets with stale prices (say with corporate bonds of the past versus today), volatility tends to be underestimated; then, one can certainly see that you do get greater volatility as markets become more liquid and efficient. Engle: Black was big on the role of noise traders as slowing down the market. If everybody was given the same information, then prices would adjust immediately to the new values. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARKET VOLATILITY AND RETURNS Sullivan: You alluded earlier to the idea that predicting volatility is easier than predicting returns. Why do you think this is the case?", "tokens": 140, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Engle: I think one of the reasons volatility is easier to predict than returns comes from the fact that when you look at a sample path, as time goes on you get more and more information about volatility, but not about returns. In fact, one of the paradoxes of modern finance is that these diffusion processes we use have the uncomfortable implication that you actually don't have to estimate volatility; you just record it by using high- frequency data. So we are getting more and more information about volatility all the time, but it doesn't give us any more information about expected returns, because you need a long span of data, and then there has to be no structural change, everything has to be constant over this long period, and all that's probably not true. Consequently, there is no hope of getting fairly precise estimates of expected returns. Ilmanen: What about the contemporaneous relation? Engle: Somewhat surprisingly, volatility and returns are negatively correlated, something that quite a few people have written about. The two general hypotheses seeking to explain it are the leverage effect and the risk aversion effect. It turns out that the leverage effect certainly is not sufficient to explain all the asymmetry in Words From the Wise: Robert Engle 5 volatility, partly because, for example, many firms don't have any debt. So there's no leverage effect at all in their fundamental asset prices, yet we still see negative correlation between volatility and their stock prices. I think a more important observation is that the negative correlation is strongest in broad indices, which is exactly where investors are most worried about volatility because that's systematic volatility, and it's unavoidable.", "tokens": 281, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "So if there is a belief that future volatility is going to be high, coming from either autocorrelation in the volatility clustering or from other information, you see a very strong effect of higher volatility when the whole market is falling sharply. I take that pattern as evidence of risk aversion, which quite possibly is getting stronger as the data seems to indicate. Sullivan: Do you believe that the risk aversion effect is more likely to be driving the negative volatility/return correlation?", "tokens": 82, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Engle: Yes, but I don't think that means that there is no leverage effect. I just think that the risk aversion effect is the most powerful contributor, but we also see asymmetry due to leverage. Emil Siriwardane and I have a paper called \"Structural GARCH\" (2015) that I presented at AQR in 2015, which builds the leverage effect exactly into stock prices. We think about stock prices as being an option on the value of the firm, then whats important is the volatility of an option price, not the volatility of a fundamental asset. Thus, the moneyness of this option matters and so we estimate the moneyness of the option and the elasticity, or the delta elasticity of it. Therefore what we do is basically de-lever the stock returns, and we find that there's still asymmetry in returns after accounting for all this. IlImanen: Has the asymmetry in returns become more pronounced since 2008 or did the rise begin even earlier? Engle: What I have noticed is that the asymmetric volatility models that we estimate, even using all the historical data, have stronger asymmetry now than they used to. But it's not quite clear when the rise started exactly. Something to look into more closely. Ilmanen: Sometimes practitioners use simpler modeling approaches such as a rolling average in estimating historical volatilities. How do you compare these simpler methods to ARCH and GARCH model approaches? Engle: I think there are some important criticisms of using historical volatilities to be aware of. One is that such models contain no information that's older than the window width that you have to work with.", "tokens": 270, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "The second is that they treat each observation within the window as equally important, whereas if we think that these models are better at short-term forecasting than long-term forecasting, you ought to give more weight to the more recent observations than the older ones. And the third thing is that it has no criterion function for choosing the best estimation window.", "tokens": 61, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Having said that, rolling historical volatilities are a kind of first generation ARCH model. So while the historical volatility approach gets it roughly right, it doesn't quite have the statistical model set out right and for instance can give some erroneous information related to the tail part of the distribution. But once you get the statistical model set out right, with an ARCH-type framework, you can get a good picture of volatility. BROADER APPLICATIONS OF MARKET VOLATILITY ESTIMATES Sullivan: Earlier you mentioned how volatility estimation is important to risk management and options pricing. Lets begin with options pricing; can you discuss the role of volatility estimation in options pricing? Engle: To figure out what an option should be worth, of course, we need to know quite a bit about the underlying price process including its volatility, its distribution and so forth. Over the years, some have sought to use volatility estimates from GARCH models as an input into the Black-Scholes model. However, it didnt prove all that useful. The main reason, I think, is that if the GARCH model is really descriptive of the Words From the Wise: Robert Engle 6 underlying return process, then Black-Scholes is not the options pricing formula that you want to use, because Black-Scholes assumes volatility is constant over the life of the option. So this leads us to more sophisticated options pricing models.", "tokens": 229, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Suppose your favorite GARCH model really does describe well what's going on in the underlying return process. Then what does your option pricing formula look like? You can now answer that question because if the GARCH model does provide the data generation process for the risk-neutral distribution, then you can then simulate it and price the options.", "tokens": 57, "label": "light"}
{"text": "I, along with two colleagues from Lugano and Lausanne (Barone-Adesi, Engle and Mancini (2008)), took this approach with S&P Index options. We used a GARCH model to price all the different strikes for short- maturity, middle-maturity and long-maturity options, all using the same four-parameter GARCH model some 250 different options contracts and it gives quite good prices. Now, this doesn't mean that it is the true underlying process, but it does mean that it's fairly consistent with an underlying process for what the risk-neutral distribution ought to look like. It gives you fat-tails, flatter smiles for the longer maturities, and all the things that we know about from looking at implied volatility pictures. So, yes, you can get all that out of a risk-neutral asymmetric GARCH distribution. Ilmanen: Can you discuss how you can estimate both asymmetries and fat tails at both short-horizon and longer-horizon? Engle: I should say that our GARCH model uses bootstrap shocks from the historical distribution, so-called filtered historical simulation. So they're fat-tailed shocks with a little bit of negative skewedness in them already. And then you pick the parameters to do the best job of fitting all these options prices. So it is very computationally intensive; you're fitting a lot of option prices with a small number of parameters. Ilmanen: Very interesting.", "tokens": 217, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Let's now move on to discuss how estimating volatility helps with risk management. Engle: I think that is actually one of the important applications of GARCH models. And whether it's exactly a GARCH model, or some other approach used by various software providers doing something quite similar, I think it provides a systematic and excellent way to assess risk in a large number of assets, factors, and so forth over the short run.", "tokens": 73, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Pedersen: Maybe you have heard this before, but some people will say, \"I buy something cheap and yes it may be volatile. The price may even drop below where I bought it. But as long as I don't sell it, and as long as I remain confident that ultimately it will return me more money than I paid for it, then volatility is not really risk. Such investors believe their capital is not permanently impaired. Have you thoughts on such comments that volatility is not a relevant measure of risk? Engle: | can understand why one might say that, but it's unclear whether one can really wait out the downturns. Even if so, it certainly doesn't mean that volatility is irrelevant. It just means that your decision process not to sell an asset that falls in price, or at least hang on to it ignores short-term volatility. So I think volatility is still useful whether it's synonymous with risk or not. In this case, one might believe that a little bit of volatility isn't bad, but a lot of negative return might be enough to have a margin call, and then it's not so benign anymore. With that said, Iam sympathetic with the idea that short-run volatility is not the only measure of risk. A key feature of the financial crisis, I think, was that short-run volatility was very low while longer-run volatility was high. A lot of investments were made as if the short-run volatility was going to stay low forever. But if you're going to invest in an asset that you're going to hold for a long period of time, you shouldn't use short- term volatility as a measure of risk. Instead, you should use a longer-run measure of volatility, because that's what this asset is going to face eventually when you liquidate it. I should mention that we're not so good at knowing what long-run volatility really is.", "tokens": 321, "label": "medium"}

One of the research projects weve taken on with the Volatility Institute relates to the regulatory environment for insurance companies. Instead of stress testing insurance companies, what is being reeommended under the EUs Solvency II is to not do just a single stress test, but do thousands of stress tests. So you have many scenarios which are equally likely, and you simulate what you think the whole financial landscape is going to look like. So insurance companies can give thought to what their strategy their portfolio or business model might look when we simulate these paths out for 50 years. You can look at the ones with a low P&L, and then those are the ones to worry about in considering whether the company is going to be able to weather the storm.", "tokens": 159, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "This type of work is a frontier that's really important in determining how best to build models to assess long-run risks. Pedersen: Are companies now being pushed towards more conservative investments by regulators with a primary focus on short-term risks? Engle: Yes. I think that's why this type of analysis has been adopted for insurance companies. A lot of the risk management for insurance companies has been looking at liability risk because unlike banks, their liabilities are more stochastic. Yet the real risks of the insurance business have to do with assets and liabilities. If you have short-run risks on one side and long-run risks on the other side, well, there are a lot of bad things that can happen. Sullivan: Can you discuss V-Lab and the Volatility Institute and what you hope to accomplish through them? Engle: The Volatility Institute was founded in 2009 here at the Stern School with a goal to leverage academics and practitioners knowledge so that we can better understand risks and volatility in financial markets and to help the broader public better understand these risks. One very successful part of this effort has been the Volatility Laboratory, or V-Lab, which has grown from a primitive laboratory for studying volatility to a highly sophisticated risk measurement and monitoring tool for the whole global economy.

Then, when the financial crisis came, we developed a systemic risk model. Its like a stress test based on market prices for more than 1,000 financial institutions around the world, updated once a week. All this information is published on the Internet.", "tokens": 113, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Its very cool. More recently, we've developed sections for market liquidity and fixed income based on this risk model scenario generator that we talked about earlier. Finally, we have a long-run risk measure, which essentially asks, \"What's the value at risk, not today, but a year from today?\" This is our first entry into answering the question we just discussed, \"How do you estimate long-run risk?\" Ilmanen: And what approach did you take in measuring market liquidity? Engle: We used the so-called Amihud (2002) ratio, which is the absolute return on a day of some particular asset divided by the dollar volume that's traded on that day. The ratio can be interpreted as a price impact, it answers the question, \"How much volume was traded and how much did the price move?\" The bigger the ratio, the more illiquid is the stock. It has the great advantage that it doesn't need bid-ask quotes, it doesn't need price impact, you don't need to know trade directions and a lot of things which are quite complicated. Words From the Wise: Robert Engle 8 So, its a nice measure. Our innovation is to use it to build a forecasting model for the time series of illiquidity. We now have a series of liquidity forecasting models for thousands of assets and people are finding it interesting, I think. Ilmanen: Back to your earlier point, what about the long-run risks?", "tokens": 235, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Engle: In thinking about this, we see that there's another risk factor that you have to take into account the risk that the risk will change. So if you think the risk will change, you have to ask yourself, how much can it change? And how do you estimate that? Well, that's what a volatility model does; it measures how much the risk changes. So if you simulate your favorite GARCH model, say 1,000 times, you get a histogram of what the future outcomes might be, and you can calculate the value at risk from this histogram. So obviously, the value at risk is greater when the volatility is greater, but because volatility is mean-reverting, it may not stay higher. And similarly, if volatility is low today, because it's mean-reverting, the forecast over the next year will show it rising. Sullivan: What sort of interest have organizations such as the Systemic Risk Council and the Treasury shown in this work? Engle: We have done a lot of work with systemic risk. Our measure, we call it SRISK, is an estimate of the amount of capital a firm would have to raise in order to continue to function normally given another financial crisis. So if you're a regulator, you would hope the answer to this question is zero, that this firm would not need to raise capital if we have another financial crisis. So it is a useful framework from the point of view of the regulatory process. However, the approach that we use employs stock market valuations of these firms, and asking how much the firms stock market valuation will likely deteriorate in a financial crisis. Unfortunately, regulators seem to have a mandate to use only detailed supervisory data on each of these financial institutions to estimate what their value would be under the counterfactual assumptions of a proposed negative event scenario. This makes for a very time-consuming and complicated job, because there are so many different kinds of assets on the books.", "tokens": 333, "label": "medium"}

So again, it's pretty similar, but not the same. On the other hand, the ECB did a stress test of capital adequacy of banks, which completely disagrees with our results. The major difference being that we think that the major banks in Europe need to strengthen their balance sheets and the ECB is more focused on smaller banks across southern Europe and Cyprus.

Engle: Yes, I would say it was a brand-new opportunity to start research in a new area where there was almost nothing and it was viewed as tremendously important. That is a gold mine for an academic, its exactly what we want. Ilmanen: Are the V-Lab systemic risk models useful for the early detection of financial crises?

{"text": "Prior to the financial crisis, it was hard for us to detect it because the stock market loved the banks and so bank capitalizations were fairly high, which means that leverage did not look so high for them as shown in the debt-to-equity ratio. So, because we use the market value of equity, we were not able to see the bust before the regulators saw it. So the model didn't give us a two-year advanced warning that this was a problem, but we have the data to show that it measured it in an important way; we can see the ranking of systemic risk of financial institutions before the crisis which is very close to the ranking of institutions that got into trouble. Ilmanen: How important are correlations when it comes to forecasting systemic risks? Engle: Our bank risk measure is based on both correlations and volatilities; more specifically their beta. We use beta, because say the global market collapses; the question is, what's that do to a bank? The answer to that question lies in the companys beta. We estimate the beta using dynamic conditional correlations, volatilities of the bank stock and volatilities of the market as a whole. We call this dynamic conditional beta, measured with a GARCH-style model. So correlations are a key part of this, but they interact with the leverage and the size in an important way.

Engle: | came to finance late in my career and was actually not so much consciously drawn into it as pulled into it. | had this success with developing the ARCH model, which | thought of as a model for macroeconomics. | kept getting invited to finance meetings to talk about volatility because even though it was originally designed for a macro problem, it actually didn't have any great applications in macro, whereas in finance, it was very popular and useful. So | gradually started going to more and more finance meetings and was fascinated by all the applications of volatility analysis and multivariate volatility analysis to finance. So it was the solution to practical problems that interested me more than actually being interested in finance itself. IImanen: If | recall correctly, the initial application for ARCH was for estimating inflation? Engle: Yes, that's right. Pedersen: Going back even further, can you discuss what drew you into economics even before finance? Engle: Yes, | went to graduate school at Cornell to study physics, and | spent one year in the basement of Rockefeller Hall of Cornell University studying low-temperature physics superconductivity and so forth which was a pretty exciting field at that time. | took classes with some famous physicists, including Hans Bethe. Yet it seemed like if | were successful, that it would only be a handful of people in the world who would be aware of my work. | wasn't likely going to have the kind of impact on society that | was hoping for. So | looked around for the most quantitative of the social sciences, and it was economics. Pedersen: At the time, did you expect that some of the math that you learned in physics would be directly applicable to economics and finance?", "tokens": 333, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Engle: | had thought that would be the case. | had various friends who would say, \"| think quantum mechanics might help with estimating economic cycles. For instance, is it a wave or a particle? But | never found, really, that any of those specific methods were useful. What is useful, | think, is the approach. Physics, like all sciences, is about the scientific method. You have hypotheses, you have experiments, you get data, you analyze the data, and you infer something about the world we live in. Well, that's what econometrics does. Econometrics takes the data and tries to make inferences about the world. That approach came from my physics background, even though the specific methodologies didn't translate very well. Pedersen: So some of us financial economists, me being one, have physics envy in the sense that in social sciences the theories are not as stable and clear as they are in physics. How do you feel about that difference? Engle: Well, | do think that's true. And physicists, who tend to have a clear view of the superiority of physics, will be quick to reinforce your physics envy. It would be nice if there were laws of economics that were as strong as they are in natural sciences. But here we're talking about people, and while that makes for interesting problems, | think it's a bit much to expect that we can be as precise as physicists.

All the people that were building vector autoregressive models switched them to vector error correction models so that they could keep the co-integration effects working properly. Meanwhile, everyone who was doing risk management wanted to know about ARCH models. So there was this big community that considered these substantive contributions.

We begin with a discussion of two of the most important and seemingly irreversible trends increased specialization and complexity and their impact on the profession and on addressing the investment challenge. During his career, Rogers successes include three global firsts: the origination of the first target date defined contribution (DC) funds (in 1988), the risk budget framework (in 1999), and the governance budget framework for assessing asset owner organizational effectiveness (in 2007). We discuss how these, among other developments, have affected the industry in support of long-term results for investors. We then gain from Rogers deep involvement in the industry in discussing the past, present and future of defined benefit (DB) and DC plans where we are now and where can we go from here to help better ensure a more secure and affordable retirement for investors? We differentiate between the two types of specialized beta (often referred to as smart beta) that Roger identifies in his work: systematic, which he refers to as better beta, such as value and momentum, and thematic which focuses on areas of under-discovered investment such as sustainable investing. We dig into how each type can play a valuable role in investor portfolios. We explore how risk management too has seen important changes as our industry has dug more deeply into what matters in risk and better measures for it. We conclude by learning about Rogers heroes and his career path that has taken him on a journey from the buy side to consulting, which all combine to make him a key industry advisor to so many. Words From the Wise: Roger Urwin 1 Addressing the Investment Challenge INVESTING BEST PRACTICES CHANGE AND INNOVATION Ilmanen: What are the important innovations that you believe have been helpful over the years?", "tokens": 603, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "Urwin: There have been increases in two dimensions of the investment challenge; one is specialization which has increased across the board. The other is complexity, which is, to some extent, a consequence of specialization. Both characteristics are just symptoms of our time, part of a secular trend that can't be turned around, as I see it. I believe they have made the investment challenge in many areas more difficult than ever. But to their credit they have spawned some important innovations. The really important ones in recent times I'd say are indexation, target date funds, liability-driven investing and smart betas. In undertaking specialization with its inherent competitive advantage, the investment industry has, I think, created a rod for its own back, because the complexity has been so intense.", "tokens": 128, "label": "light"}
{"text": "It has made the holistic management of our financial institutions more challenging. Even with the improvements that I see in process, organizational effectiveness, and in investment tools, I still see that accomplishing the mission financial institutions have set for themselves has not become easier; it has become harder. It seems we've been running faster than ever, as in the Red Queens Race, to simply stay still. Ilmanen: Can you discuss good and bad practices that youve observed? Urwin: One of the interesting points about industry structure in investing is that historically we've had relatively weak investment governance among the asset owners of the world. The biggest and best asset owners in the world are still struggling to come to terms with being effective in their investment process and practices. The good news is that the different institutions I've dealt with have been raising their game with respect to investment governance although many would say its overdue. Investment success is really about the coming together of prolonged endeavor, effective culture and cutting- edge thinking, and the emergence of results over extended periods. The good practices that I see are usually associated with getting a better balance between internal resources and external delegations. The world-class asset owners of 20 years ago were largely run through external delegation to outside firms. Now, although, we're seeing much stronger capabilities among the biggest asset owners, challenges still exist with how they manage the mix of internal and external management.", "tokens": 244, "label": "medium"}

Investment success is really about the coming together of prolonged endeavor, effective culture and cutting-edge thinking, and the emergence of results over extended periods. This means that success is much more observable in the quality of processes rather than seeing this year's results. * We thank Jennifer LaForce and April Frieda for useful comments and suggestions, and Jennifer Buck and Pete Amis for their production support.", "tokens": 122, "label": "light"}
{"text": "From Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871). Words From the Wise: Roger Urwin 2 Sullivan: So one key aspect of success is about balancing internal resources against external delegation. A failure might therefore be in an investment organization not having enough resources to accomplish their specific strategy? Urwin: The choice that asset owners often face is deciding whether to raise their game or simplify their strategy. In raising their game, resources have to be adequate for the complexity of the challenge, and they have to be competitively positioned as they are competing for the sorts of return that they require to be successful. On the other hand, simplifying your strategy is another formula for success. To borrow from Charley Ellis (1975), it's making sure that you don't lose the loser's game. Interestingly, however, relatively few funds feel good about taking this idea to the extreme that is taking a purely passive approach. Nonetheless it remains an approach to be successful, albeit without the ambition that most of us carry. Sullivan: How do you advise firms in making the choice between raising their game versus simplifying?", "tokens": 191, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Urwin: To state the obvious, it's a very big ask to be successful in scale at delivering alpha. On the other hand, there are opportunities to be strategically well positioned in some betas which few funds currently exploit. Funds including large ones can vary their inter-temporal exposures to beta risk with respect to the economic regimes experienced across market environments, something like dynamic asset allocation by another name. Both extracting alpha and dynamic beta present a challenge, but I'm struck by how many big asset owners have the odds stacked against them in the strategies they choose to pursue. The accepted practices of our time have been largely the continuation of certain ways of doing For me, a lot of consulting is oriented towards what I call change practices. The accepted practices of our time have been largely the continuation of certain ways of doing things, which seem almost more like folklore than the outcomes of scientific study. Its not easy for asset owners to decide how to organize themselves. But it makes sense for them to be more realistically erounded in what they can achieve and how best to allocate their scarce resources.", "tokens": 194, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "things, which seem almost more like folklore than the outcomes of scientific study. Ilmanen: You mentioned changing ones risk and beta stance depending on the environment. By this, do you mean market timing? Reminds me of the old saying, there are no old market timers, meaning its hard to be consistently successful with market timing. Urwin: Its quite difficult to be dogmatic about what works and what doesn't work, because there's so much context to these issues. But I would tend to argue that frequent interventions in allocation often referred to as market timing are very much an odds-against practice. That is, the odds seem quite poor to succeed with market timing and the key reason for this is that you have too few marginal calls to make this is invoking the fundamental law of active management. However making time-varying risk exposures by virtue of the current investment regime and your appetite for risk carries many more advantages because you are working with calls that are no longer marginal. They are compellingly attractive. The investment thesis bears upon the changing maturity profile and life cycle of different investors, organizations and macro conditions. So, applying time-varying risk budgets seem to me to be a worthwhile activity with odds-on success.", "tokens": 208, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Sullivan: Can you give an example of your time-varying risk budget idea? Urwin: A simple version of this is the life cycle design used often in DC plans, and one I worked to develop in the mid 1980s. Investment theory demonstrates very clearly that the most efficient return per unit of risk, all else being equal, emanates from equal risk budget amounts over time. This leads to the fairly simple kind of Words From the Wise: Roger Urwin 3 configuration that investing in the growth phase of DC needs to be very risk-oriented, and then there needs to be some reduction in risk profile as an individual goes into their income decumulation phase. The equivalent in DB plans is for funds that stop accruing their liabilities. They have the same sort of challenge to vary their risk budgets according to those circumstances. If they don't, they are in serious trouble, because the problems of underfunding in mature situations can create snow-balling issues. The problems of compounding wealth under drawdown situations can be really terminal. It obviously eats into a fund much more severely when a pension plan is frozen and in an outgo phase. Now, that's actually just simple investment math.", "tokens": 201, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "If you layer on top of it the concept that we do have regimes where the return to risky assets is set at higher levels or lower levels. These regimes might be five years; they might be 10 years though I tend to think that they're more likely to be 10 years but therefore, this layering of \"there are good and bad times in an institutional history to allocate to risk, depending on conditions, creates opportunities. This is really about using the principles of internal rate of return (IRR) that apply money-weighted opportunities, as opposed to the time-weighted principles that we typically present in our investment materials. At the moment, I believe we have a problem of many institutions thinking that they have to take more risk to get to the CPI-plus-five percent that makes their world better balanced. But in many respects, they should have had more risk when markets were supportive of CPI-plus-five and even higher. The high level of risk taking funds are lured into now is a bit like closing the stable gate after the horse has already bolted. Sullivan: So, you're suggesting risk budgeting and risk allocation as driven by the life cycle of the individual or the plan, rather than as a function of the market cycle? Urwin: Well Im arguing for both. Mostly, I've been describing life-cycle-driven allocation according to the investment context. But, Iam also saying that layered on top of that is a regime consideration. Short-term market timing is more associated with the term market timing, but investors should look for opportunities to exploit, for example, a decade regime, or a secular regime as well. It's an interesting challenge at present, whether to use modest leverage to amplify returns when you have really skinny risk premia. No single answer there, but the specific answer relates to risk tolerance preferences tied to longer-term mission considerations using life-cycle thinking and money-weighted returns. GOVERNANCE Ilmanen: Earlier when you discussed governance, you mentioned the balance between internal and external resources.", "tokens": 335, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "How should the board balance micromanagement of investments versus focusing on overall strategy and governance? Urwin: A lot of my early work in the investment profession was technical, based on classically schooled investing. But gradually, I felt that I was missing so much of the action by not working harder on how individuals and organizations actually make their decisions. This was when the term investment governance became more and more common. Investment decision-making is almost always a collective decision. It reflects both the board of an institution or investment committee and the executives who work at that institution and the delegated agents of that institution. Each of those groups comes together, and decisions are made. What has been so striking to me in my consulting life was that early on we'd spent so much time working on assessing the great investment managers of the time, and we neglected the great investment committees of the time. Early in this journey I found that a Google search on great investment managers generated literally millions of hits, but great investment committee yielded a null set. Fascinating. Sullivan: Youve done a lot to fill that gap in the literature over the years. Words From the Wise: Roger Urwin 4", "tokens": 205, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Urwin: From this observation, working with my academic partner Gordon Clark of Oxford University we created a global best-practice governance model. It encompasses a large number of factors, most of which are soft factors that are tacit and quite subjective. We didnt find our factors were as simple as investment committees should be between 5 and 7 members (by-the-way good idea in some contexts). Instead we found that an investment organization having a learning and adaptive culture that constantly challenges conventional thinking was a factor in success. The Clark and Urwin (2007) governance model still is intrinsically the same structure with 12 critical factors. It produces a credit rating, just that here the impairment of credit is more like an assessment of possible impairment to mission. If you get a AAA rating, your mission is relatively secure, but if you are sub investment grade your mission is at risk. Investment committee practice has evolved from some very casual approaches when I first started in the industry, to now more discipline and reliance on investment expertise. for both the asset owner The best-practices model of today is unrecognizable from when investment committees and ; I started. asset management investment committees, there's much work Speaking both from an asset owner point of view and from to do to better understand the the point of view of how asset managers do their work in investment committees, there are still a number of limitations in how investment committees add value. The reason is that we haven't yet come to understand well the dynamics of groups and how to distill individual perspectives into a collective decision. These are quite subtle situations. concepts of collective decision-making. So, for both the asset-owner investment committees and asset-management investment committees, there's much work to do to better understand the concepts of collective decision making. Just as a portfolio is able to do better from uncorrelated assets, a group of individuals on a committee can definitely do better from uncorrelated thinking, values and also experiences. How best to make it work, however, remains a challenge.", "tokens": 345, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Ilmanen: So, avoid the madness of crowds?", "tokens": 7, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Urwin: Good point. To get the wisdom of crowds you create conditions for independent ideas to come together. But when we meet as a group, our ideas become more correlated through the principles of group think and social affirmation basically all of the issues that a lack of diversity brings. We get at best the sroupthink of crowds and at worst the madness of crowds. The specific context of investment decisions makes this a lot more toxic. To borrow a phrase out of American military, we invest under conditions of volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous conditions, or VUCA. To be effective in making decisions, our thinking processes must deal with all those VUCA dimensions. Because so many investment settings are uncertain and ambiguous, the process of settling the views of many investment professionals is highly problematic. But the more you do think about that, I think the more you recognize that the typical way that we run our meetings does not lead to the state of good diversity in thinking. There is a yet-to-be found formula a more definitive theory and practice of investment committee decision making. Ilmanen: Other thoughts on best practices for plan sponsors? Urwin: The upskilling of plan sponsors and other asset owners is an encouraging sign that we may do better in the next financial crisis. We have lived through an era of asset rich - time poor.", "tokens": 232, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Now we have a more effective picture with much more skilled asset owner CIOs. Words From the Wise: Roger Urwin 5 A good example is the work being done in investment beliefs. Asset owners have been increasing attention to the areas of their investment beliefs such as investment philosophy and value system. Best practice has always involved connecting the dots among many funds, and some are now doing this quite well. I find an interesting difference between the way that asset owners/plan sponsors have evolved and how asset managers have evolved. For investment managers, though also schooled in investment philosophies, beliefs and values, it hasnt seemed as productive to deepen their thinking this way. I can only ascribe that to some of the consequences of the secular push towards specialization of mandates. So the type of thinking that is needed in forming investment beliefs is essentially done for the manager in the specification of the mandate.", "tokens": 156, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "I'm mildly troubled by that outcome because I would like to see the asset management industry have a more multi-asset, full-service reach that deepens their thinking in establishing a value system. This directional push towards specialization has made things a bit difficult for most asset management organizations. The breadth of an organization like AQR is quite unusual. PENSION PLAN FUNDING DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Sullivan: Lets now turn to another challenging topic, pension plan funding. Urwin: Overall, in most parts of the world pension fund balance sheets are obviously stressed. Because pensions are future assets and liabilities with ongoing sponsor support you dont need to immediately balance the balance sheet. But we have a chronic bad habit with dealing with underfunding by kicking the can down the road. And the specter of a slow-motion pension train wreck has come to haunt me. Ilmanen: Would you advocate plans bite the bullet here and immunize despite low bond yields or continue to use risky assets to try to climb out of the underfunding? Urwin: The flippant answer is yes and yes. Combining DB and DC plans, there are about $40 trillion of total pension assets worldwide with about half of that in DB plans (Willis Towers Watson (2016)). Liability-driven investing (LDI) is best seen as hedging, not matching. Some funds have been adapting to liability management through derivative positions. This has already helped some funds in adapting to the current low bond yields. However, the bond market can absorb even more pension hedging while accepting there are limits. I tend to think doing more hedging makes sense. But I also think it is possible, and likely desirable, for many funds to run a partially-hedged position with the help of derivatives and also have a portion of the assets continuing to take risk.

Ilmanen: The Dutch, who seem to be among the countries with the best pension finances, are nonetheless among the least happy people on this topic, perhaps because there is a greater awareness about pension- related challenges. Urwin: We've created institutions that are very difficult to manage and ambiguous in terms of how good they are. It's just not totally clear if we've got the best pension system or the worst pension system in any country. These are very long-term settlements; they involve multiple generations being added together.

Ilmanen: If you are not thinking too much of the next generation, then you are happier to roll the dice and hope for the best? Urwin: There is a really neat paper on intergenerational equity recently published in the FAJ that, as you suggest, discusses the existence of a generational temptation to roll the dice (Bader (2015)). There are very clear incentives that make that a desirable feature. However, its important to find a way to give voice to the future generation stakeholder. Consider how, in the past, some used pensions as a negotiating tool rather than focus on pay, which tends to be less flexible. Sullivan: Where did the use of pensions in this way begin? Urwin: There are examples stretching back, but a good one is from Australia where the Australian Superannuation Guarantee, originally a three-percent employer contribution, was paid into a DC account instead of a pay rise beginning in the early 1990s. And so as a result of an old bargain, you've had 25-plus years of the growth of a DC system. South Africa is very similar. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS Sullivan: Do you think this change from DB to DC was desirable? Urwin: I have a somewhat pragmatic point of view, that it was inevitable that we would never be able to secure the intergenerational equity needed to make DB a fair deal for all parties. The reason really is that the risk sharing of the employer and the members of the defined benefit fund is almost impossible to describe. It's too reliant on the social capital between employers and workers that has over time been weakening. So, employers found their way out of the overcommitted undertakings of DB and moved on to DC with the dual benefits of fixed and lower costs.", "tokens": 373, "label": "medium"}

I'm a big believer that DC will take on better design features in the future, but for a number of governance reasons, it has been a very slow-moving machine. Ilmanen: Resulting perhaps in an unlucky generation of investors. Urwin: Unfortunately yes, DC, as it currently works, is not a pension income system. Its more of clunky savings system with low contributions. Where defined benefit was 15% to 20% of payroll, DC has been around five-percent to 10% savings.

Sullivan: What are some better design features that could help close the gap? Urwin: At the moment, DC design is weak and institutions are not taking responsibility for any consolidation of pension savings, pre- and post-retirement. Take a 401(k) plan in the U.S. It acts as an accumulation vehicle through to a target date, but the design doesn't lead to a particularly effective hand-off into a post-retirement income benefit guarantee.

It's really about overcoming the quirks of individuals for success with our retirement outcomes; in a word nudging them. But, I am quite positive about people taking more responsibility for their pension income, and I'm certainly not of the view that the majority of people should be destined to buy a low-yielding annuity at retirement.

Urwin: I always start my thinking off with what I call the world market portfolio of investables, which has about $90 trillion of liquid assets stocks, bonds and commodities and about $10 trillion of alternatives roughly $6 trillion of real estate, $3 trillion of private equity and $1 trillion of infrastructure (Doeswijk, Lam, Swinkels (2014)).", "tokens": 120, "label": "light"}

We don't keep score well enough to recognize what an impediment the costs are to achieving ultimate success. SYSTEMATIC VS THEMATIC BETA Sullivan: You have been part of the smart beta movement from the beginning; tell us how that came about. Urwin: At Watson Wyatt, we had a research team called the Thinking Ahead Group (TAG) that wrote about risk-weighted, fundamental-weighted, and value-weighted investing in 2002 and 2003 using the term beta prime to capture the premia we were finding. So, we were enthusiastic protagonists for those systematic factor approaches around that time although clients didn't particularly like it. It was very similar to the passage of index funds in the 1970s. So as a result, and much to my surprise really, the idea went quiet, but then it came back after the Global Financial Crisis, and it was then we tried using the term smart beta (Watson Wyatt (2007)). Smart beta then became defined at Towers Watson as a vehicle for methods that combined mechanistic rules-based, simple governance, low cost, with a projectable economic rationale, and a return driver that compensates for the risk taken.

Urwin: To me systematic beta is a technical capture of better beta. Gene Fama describes it well when he says that the value premium is about different prices for different volatilities. I like to describe it as different prices for different risks to different investors. So value turns out to be exposure to bad-time risk which provides the return driver for the valuation premium. Ilmanen: We employ four systematic betas: value, momentum, carry and defensive (which combines quality and low risk). Urwin: Yes, we are consistent with that in our thinking. Each of those has a projectable economic rationale. So, while there can be behavioral mispricing (a pricing anomaly), to me the principal return driver for most of these is different risks and the heterogeneous views that price them. Ilmanen: Makes sense.", "tokens": 436, "label": "heavy"}

{"text": "Urwin: Yes, I would. Ilmanen: Some include different weighting schemes, like equal-weighted or maximum-diversification, as part of smart beta. Urwin: Risk-weighted is actually the equivalent of the thinking in risk parity. Its about the degree of efficient return per unit risk Ilmanen: Yes. Lets get back to your distinction between systematic smart beta and thematic smart beta. Urwin: Yes. The thematic version of beta says that certain areas of investment will remain under-discovered and by implication, underpriced. So, in thematic beta, the proposition is more behavioral related. So, while there can be behavioral mispricing (a pricing anomaly), to me the principal source of return Sullivan: Can you give an example? driver for most of these Urwin: Sustainability. It is based on the concept that most invest [factors] is different risks with a low regard for externalities. So, thematic beta is about a and the heterogeneous kind of first-mover advantage; it is not permanent, it doesnt last views that price them. forever.

{"text": "Systematic beta is focused on risk premia with an empirically solid foundation, which is a more top-down inductive approach. Whereas a thematic type of investment requires a beliefs-based, bottom-up approach, which is more based on deductive thinking. So, justifying sustainability to me warrants more of a deductive approach, not just based on track records. But the investment world is thoroughly schooled in needing its inductive fixes. So, for a low-carbon approach to be considered we would first need proof in the performance. Now, if you believe, as I do, that the financial system is a complex system that is never quite in equilibrium, then any historical projection carries the problem of the intermediate pricing point that it can be high or low. So, projecting an alpha from a factor is difficult. Its almost the wrong way around based on the benefit of hindsight, the period in which you've done your analysis. So, it challenges some of the principles by which investment research is organized; as in, it becomes less obvious that you need to be pure in your econometric or data-driven approaches. Words From the Wise: Roger Urwin 10 Ilmanen: We are in the systematic camp who study historical experience extensively, but even we want to think hard why any long-term regularity exists: Is it caused by some risk aversion or irrationality?

Sustainability is fascinating; there are two dimensions of utility vying with each other financial utility and an extra utility which is non-financial.

The organizations I advise are trying to sort all this out, but its a really difficult issue. Ilmanen: How does this tie into the universal owner idea? Urwin: I think universal owner is quite an important concept. It is really about ownership influence and making sure that the objective function of the organization is attuned to the mission of the organization, which one firstly assumes to be a wealth-maximizing utility. The universal owner assumes that they, as long- term holders, can through ownership rights influence wealth. For example, weaning companies off lobbying costs to a universal owner lobbying is net-value destructive across their whole portfolio. But then a universal owner may well think about their objective function as not just a wealth-maximizing utility, but also a wellbeing-maximizing utility, where wellbeing may include environmental conditions. It argues for creating portfolios that are potentially lighter in externalities than the market. Of course that's a thesis, and it needs deductive logic to make it work. Ilmanen: And you might accept a few basis points lower returns for that? Urwin: This gets into a debating point about the mission of the organization. We have yet to come to terms with the ethical tiebreaker which says it's absolutely fine to commit to an ethical cause if the prospective investment return is roughly tied. Interestingly, many funds have come to terms with being out of tobacco even though tobacco has been the number one sector over the last 100 years.

{"text": "RISK MANAGEMENT Ilmanen: Lets turn to practices in risk management. Urwin: In my career I have seen risk management become bigger and bigger. I think the perspective on what matters in risk is much better understood than it used to be. Some of the measures of what we look at to understand risk are more insightful now than what we had in the past. But I'm still struck by the pattern that we tend to measure what we can, and de-emphasize things that we don't seem to be able to measure, even when they matter more than the things that we can measure. For example, the key risk to a DB plan is mission impairment risk, which more often than not would emanate from something in the financing covenant configuration than in the investment policies. We calculate Value at Risk for the portfolio to two decimal places, but the key dimension lies in some different place altogether. Ilmanen: What sort of things would cause that mission impairment? Urwin: The key dimension to most DB mission impairment is simply the sponsor becoming insolvent. Now, obviously, if you've invested your funds in a correlated way with a sponsor, you've made that risk worse, but very few pension funds think that one through or practice an integrated approach to their risk.", "tokens": 218, "label": "medium"}

On the other hand, an endogenous model is one where the stakeholders are part of the system and we view their behaviors as sources of risk and return at the same time. There is a spectrum from highly quantifiable like calculating historic Value at Risk, to things that are not very quantifiable, like estimating the risk of longevity for a DB plan. Sullivan: So where do you see the practice of risk going? Urwin: Its a bit corny to say it should go wider, longer and deeper but thats basically it. Wider in that the central element of investing is achieving success with a unique fund-specific mission which specifies the stakeholders and time horizons that need management. The definitions used in mainstream finance are narrow and dont reflect much relevance really. Then there is a need for a lengthening of the time horizon to risk. While mainstream finance risk is calculated from measures that are daily or monthly, longer-term risk is really about periods as long as decades and consistent with missions that are multi-decade in nature. The deepening of risk is about picking up fatter tails and the non-stationary elements and also, the asymmetrical pieces. Risk done well looks at the whole return distribution.

Here, he finds that individuals are much more human than the so-called homo economicus (economic man); that is, humans sometimes make irrational decisions. Our conversation with Professor Thaler begins with a brief behavioral economics retrospective discussing how all economists, from the very early days of Adam Smith, considered the human behaviors of everyone in the economy, but then we lost sight of the human element for a while. We then turn to examining how behavioral economics has once again found its place in the economists toolkit and how it influences modern day thinking and research. As one example, it helps in thinking about the degree of market efficiency and the behavioral characteristics possibly embedded in asset pricing models. This then leads naturally to a discussion of the degree to which investors are able to exploit irrational market behaviors. Along the way, we also learn about the three categories in which behavioral finance can be a useful tool for improving outcomes: self-improvement; improvement of others, and investing. Here, we consider the concept of nudge theory and the powerful impact it has had, among many others, on helping people save more for retirement. We conclude by hearing about Thalers most proud accomplishments, his heroes, and whether he has any regrets.", "tokens": 488, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "04 Words from the Wise Richard Thaler Evolution of Behavioral Finance Sullivan: You're regarded as one of the fathers of behavioral economics, and it seems as though it's taken a long while for behavioral economics to take its rightful place alongside the other pillars of finance and economics. Do you agree, and if so, why do you think it's taken so long? Thaler: Well, in the very early days, all economics was behavioral; certainly, Adam Smith was a behavioral economist.t For example, in his The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), he discusses self- control problems. In my language, this is about our eternal conflicts between our immediate desires and impulses what I call our doer and our more reasoned and far-sighted thoughts what I call our planner. Smith used the impartial spectator instead of planner, but the ideas are essentially the same. Smith also talks about other aspects of human nature emphasized by modern behavioral economists including loss aversion and overconfidence. So, Smith was definitely a behavioral economist. There were many other important contributions to behavioral economics, but I would say that the father of behavioral finance is John Maynard Keynes. His Chapter 12, The State of Long-Term Expectation, from The General Theory (1936) is brilliant.", "tokens": 206, "label": "medium"}

You'll see that he anticipates things like limits to arbitrage, and of course the famous beauty contest was a deep insight. NMR Sullivan: Iremember he also discussed how in making decisions on issues we dont really understand, we just follow what our neighbors do. Thaler: Yes, which relates to the famous line that it's better to fail conventionally than succeed unconventionally.3 Sullivan: Yes, exactly. Thaler: Then there's another great line about the excess volatility of stocks, how markets overreact to news, which anticipates some of Shillers work (e.g., 1981). So, economics was totally behavioral up until around the 1950s. I think what happened was that some of the prominent economists around that time set out to make economics more rigorous. This is a completely admirable activity, because until you make it rigorous, nobody really knows what it is exactly.", "tokens": 154, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Samuelson, Arrow, Solow, among others, and even von Neumann and Morgenstern earlier, all took a big step forward for economics by rigorously writing down the math. Then what I think happened is that a curious norm developed: If the agents in my model are smarter than the agents in your model, then my model is better than your model. Consider the well-known consumption models. So, Keynes' model is C (consumption) is proportional to Y (income), which See, for instance Ashraf, Camerer, and Loewenstein (2005): \"... professional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view. 3 Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally (Keynes 1936). 4 Day-to-day fluctuations in the profits of existing investments, which are obviously of an ephemeral and non-significant character, tend to have an altogether excessive, and even an absurd, influence on the market (Keynes 1936). by the way, is a very good, approximation. Then Friedman comes along and says, no, it's not just Y, it's Permanent Y, defined as a three-year moving average of Y. Well, that's clearly a smarter, better model. Then Modigliani comes along with a more complicated version in which consumers plan their entire lifetime consumption path, and then Barro added future generations, and so on. There was no logical place to stop, and so the models get more and more sophisticated.", "tokens": 308, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "I enter the story around 1980, armed with my buddies Kahneman and Tversky, who are providing these brilliant demonstrations of, say, framing effects that threaten any model. For example, they show that people (including physicians) make different choices between treatments depending on whether the outcomes are expressed in terms of the probability of living or dying, although they are just two ways of expressing the same probability. So words matter! But try writing down a formal model that's going to capture whether our experiment uses P instead of 1 - P. No formal model is going to say those two things are different from one another, but they are.

Do you agree?", "tokens": 141, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Thaler: Gene is a good friend of mine, and like all of us, he follows where the research leads. Take his view on the CAPM, which has evolved over the years. Early in his career, he thought the market factor alone provided an accurate model of markets. However, his research has since shown that additional explanatory factors help explain the cross section of returns, which has led to the Words from the Wise Richard Thaler 05 three-factor model, and now a five-factor model, which improves on the single-factor CAPM. Ilmanen: Where do you see the two camps diverge? Thaler: Mainly on the interpretation of the empirical evidence whether the factors are mainly driven by risk or behavior. Within the three- factor model, value certainly has a plausible risk interpretation (although there is no evidence that value stocks are in fact riskier than growth stocks). However, there have been explanatory factors added more recently that have been shown to be quite robust but have no plausible risk story. The profitability and momentum factors are good examples. Ilmanen: What lessons have you learned from Fama and others from the rational camp? Thaler: All of my research in finance starts with the efficient market hypothesis as the null hypothesis, just as my work on self-control and individual saving started with the life cycle model as the null hypothesis, which assumes that people rationally plan their savings and consumption behavior over their life cycle. Standard models have been essential building blocks to behavioral economics.", "tokens": 250, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "I have also learned a great deal from the Fama- French three-factor model and its extensions, as I alluded to a moment ago. Ilmanen: How do limits to arbitrage influence your view of market efficiency? Thaler: Take the Palm and 3Com mispricing case around the year 2000; yes, there were limits to arbitrage preventing the convergence of the two 06 Words from the Wise Richard Thaler stock prices, but that market was just too small for firms like AQR to trade on the arbitrage opportunity at a meaningful size. Also, I should point out that the mispricing still requires Larry Summer's idiots (Summers 1986) because there were people who were buying just Palm. That's not limits to arbitrage; that's just irrational behavior, right? Ilmanen: How has research changed with the rise of behavioral economics? Thaler: I think we've now had more than 20 years of PhD students who have been learning about behavioral economics and are treating it as just part of the repertoire of economists tools. Consider Raj Chetty, who's perhaps the best economist of his generation. Although he doesnt identify as one, he's partly a behavioral economist; that is, he's as behavioral as he needs to be. For instance, he writes a paper about whether taxes are salient or not (Chetty, Looney, and Kroft 2009). That's a research question he probably wouldn't have written about if he had been born 30 years earlier. Jesse Shapiro, who I also think the world of, has written some of the best mental accounting papers. This pragmatic research approach be behavioral when it is needed is what I was after in my 1999 paper \"The End of Behavioral Finance\" (Thaler 1999). 5 See, for instance, Hastings and Shapiro (2013). Sullivan: That prediction was nearly 20 years ago now, you said that In the not-too-distant future, the term behavioral finance will be correctly viewed as a redundant phrase. What other kind of finance is there? Has the field of finance achieved your vision? Thaler: I was a bit premature, but yes, I think we're getting closer to my goal of behavioral economics disappearing. Most economists under 40 are at least open to behavioral explanations. Sullivan: Has behavioral economics become a mainstay in undergraduate textbooks? Thaler: Sadly, no. Most Econ 101 textbooks include very little on behavioral economics (and little about any kind of finance). Usually, there is just one chapter on behavioral, and typically its the most controversial one. Half the people love it and say it's the most interesting chapter in the book, and the other half hate it because it comes at the end, and the students say, \"Wait a minute! Why were you making us read all this stuff up to this point?\" Honestly, I do not know how [d write an Econ 101 book, it would be very difficult. Words from the Wise Richard Thaler 07 Behaviors and Investing Ilmanen: How has your thinking on market efficiency changed over the years? Thaler: Well, at one level trading markets seem to have become far more efficient. So, we now have high-speed trading, which means price discovery happens in milliseconds. The costs of trading are now minuscule as well. This is all great for investors and has made the market for trading very efficient. It's not something that I've studied carefully, but evidence seems to suggest that markets are becoming slightly more efficient in the hard to beat sense. It wouldn't be surprising if the rest of the world is catching up to the US in terms of difficulty of beating the market. Ilmanen: What about efficiency in terms of the market price being correct? Thaler: It's very hard to say anything definitive about whether the price is right, Especially at the aggregate level. I will say that recent history has not suggested that bubbles have disappeared; take for instance, Bitcoin. Fischer Black once said that the market price is typically right within a factor of two.", "tokens": 656, "label": "heavy"}

So, yes, in some ways I'm making a very traditional rational economic argument, that the cross- sectional efficiency of markets is really competitive, especially in large cap, but not as much at the asset class, or macro level. Not many manage money via tactical asset allocation these days. I once asked George Soros during the tech bubble, \"If you thought the S&P 500 was 30% overvalued, what would you do?\" He replied, \"Nothing.\" He said if you bet on markets returning to intrinsic value, you'll die of boredom. So, even Soros in his heyday wasn't making those kinds of bets. Although there are people doing it a little bit around the edges, maybe they'll tilt a little more toward emerging markets for instance. That's really the weak part of the efficient market hypothesis, because you have to ask who is it that's making those tactical bets?

{"text": "Ilmanen: Will Goetzmann (2016) recently showed how difficult it is to effectively trade against bubbles as they can go on surprisingly long. Thaler: Gene [Fama] too makes the point that you cannot predict when a bubble is going to end. I completely agree. During the tech bubble I thought it was a bubble in '96 as did Shiller. If I had been a hedge fund manager, I would have gone broke before the bubble burst in 2000. Then theres the real estate bubble of mid-2000s, Shiller was again writing about it very early. 6 Editor's note: Black passed away in 1995, a couple of years before the tech bubble really heated up. 08s Words from the Wise Richard Thaler Also, the period of low volatility during the first part of the Trump presidency was a surprise to me.

{"text": "Ilmanen: Some observers point out that there are no old market timers on the Forbes list of billionaires. The success rate is too low on one concentrated bet for consistent success. Thaler: Right, and that's what we would expect from the evidence. There's a little bit of predictability at a 10-year horizon, but not enough that you could possibly run a business. Ilmanen: Do you think behavioral finance is more useful for correcting ones own biases or exploiting others' biases? Thaler: I would say that it's useful for both. In fact, I'd say there are three categories: self-improvement; improvement of others, like nudging; and investing. I think behavioral finance is useful in all three categories. Regarding self-improvement, we can, for instance, learn that if you're addicted to cashews to not buy cashews. On the improvement of others, we can devise 401(k) plans that are more user-friendly with nudge features, such as automatic enrollment and automatic escalation. We can also build plans that include sensible target-date funds and include them as the default plan for auto-enrollment. These are things that will help improve retirement outcomes. Ilmanen: Indeed, your nudging research to encourage people to save more for retirement seems to have been very effective. A great example of research having important real-world outcomes. Thaler: A related topic that I've been interested in recently involves people's choices of healthcare plans. There's an estimate that about half of the people who are choosing among employer- sponsored healthcare plans are choosing a dominated option (meaning they will pay more in total no matter how much health care they consume). The main mistake people make is buying a plan with too low of a deductible. So, they'll pay $500 to lower the deductible by $250, keeping everything else is the same. There's no risk factor here.", "tokens": 301, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Something I've been thinking about is how to help people with that issue. Sullivan: There seems to be some misguided risk aversion there.", "tokens": 23, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Thaler: Yes. So, the basic recipe is that you should select the high-deductible plan if your employer offers one and also to max out your health care spending account (HSA). The tricky details are what to do with low-paid workers who could have liquidity constraints because the HSAs are typically funded gradually during the year. So, if you have, say, a$4,000 deductible and you have a medical bill to pay in January, there won't be enough money available in your HSA to cover it. So, I've been trying to figure out how to solve that issue.", "tokens": 96, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Ilmanen: What about the third behavioral finance category, investing? Thaler: Well, obviously that's how we try to make money at Fuller & Thaler. We look for places where investors are most likely to be biased. We do this in a less quantitative way than AQR, and we invest in mostly small-cap stocks. Ilmanen: Do you have a value tilt? Thaler: Our biggest product is small-cap value, but philosophically we're not a traditional value shop. We're pure behavioral in the sense that we seek any stock that we believe likely to be mispriced. When the firm first began, I think we called our funds overreaction and underreaction but soon learned that there was no market for those names, so we changed to more traditional names, small-cap value and growth. In-house, we still call them overreaction strategies and underreaction strategies. I often say that our philosophy is to predict other people's mistakes. I sometimes use a baseball analogy. Suppose that there's a sinker ball pitcher who throws a ball that dips as it comes to the batter. Every baseball fan knows that that will produce a lot of ground balls because it fools the batter into swinging a quarter of an inch too high. Now, the reason why I like that example is that if I tried to swing at such a pitch, there's no chance I would even make contact. Ok, well maybe out of a hundred, I might make contact once, out of luck. My best strategy would be to hold the bat out and hope that the ball hits the bat.

{"text": "Nevertheless, I can predict the mistake of professional baseball players. So, that's our philosophy, to predict the mistakes of professional investors and analysts. And so, we'll say this is a situation where analysts will underestimate earnings next quarter which is like predicting that that hitter will hit a ground ball. This is just one example of how to use behavioral finance in investing. Sullivan: Are humans more susceptible to behavioral biases versus other animals? Thaler: No, not at all. Amos [Tversky] used to have this line about how there were once species that didn't exhibit loss aversion, but they're now extinct! Now, I should say he meant it as a joke. He hada lot of great one-liners, but there is a sense in which loss aversion is rational if you're at subsistence level, right? So, for humans, that was for the first 30,000 or 40,000 years of our existence. Ilmanen: What about those who connect evolution and behavioral biases or rationality? Thaler: I really disagree when people say, \"we evolved this way; therefore, it must be rational.\" That makes no sense. We're an obese society now because for most of our existence eating as much as we could whenever we could was a really good strategy. The problem is, of course, that there's no way to test any of these stories.", "tokens": 221, "label": "medium"}

{"text": "Thaler: I have not found neuro to be particularly helpful to me. It's not that I'm against neuroscience; some of my best friends are neuroeconomists. The challenge I keep giving them is to write a paper that does one of two things. It either teaches me something about human behavior that I didn't think I already knew and had demonstrated. For instance, I already believe in loss aversion. If you tell me that losses and gains light up in different places in the brain, thats interesting, but I have not learned anything new. So, teach me something I didn't think I already knew. It isn't very hard; I don't know very much. The second would be to teach me something that I thought is true but is actually false. Either one of those. So far there are a lot of very fancy colored pictures, but nothing that's gotten me excited. Ilmanen: Maybe one day. Thaler: Yes, let all flowers bloom. Words from the Wise Richard Thaler 11 Accomplishments, Heroes and Regrets Ilmanen: What achievements are you most proud of? Thaler: Among my academic contributions, I'm very proud of the up-and-coming generation of behavioral economists, as I've actively pursued nurturing them. Obviously, writing papers is a passive way of doing that, but we've been having these behavioral economics summer camps since 1994, which have helped to build academic interest in the topic.

Some people worry that Im advocating a nanny state, but it's actually the opposite it's preventing the nanny state, because our programs always allow opt-out. So, to those who say we are being paternalistic and think we should have no choice architecture at all, I say this is impossible. If you have a 401(k) plan for instance, it has to be either opt-in or opt-out. You have forms, and you have to decide how many funds to offer and so on, right?", "tokens": 118, "label": "light"}

The ethos I've tried to generate with the nudge public policy units there are only two that I have been deeply involved with, one in the UK and one in the US, the others were all launched on their own I say often that we can't do evidence- based policy without evidence. So, every policy intervention comes with what we call a randomized control trial, or RCT. I don't think that should be politically controversial. Our country spends about one sixth of our GDP on healthcare. If we can make people healthier without banning alcohol or sugary sodas, that would be a good thing. So, yes there are lots of things that we could suggest that would be purely paternalistic and objectionable to many, but we choose to approach policy intervention with what we call libertarian paternalism, which of course is the concept of nudge.

I will say that, especially if you read 12 Words from the Wise Richard Thaler Misbehaving, you could come away thinking that this is aman who had a grand plan to lead an insurrection and change a field. But in reality, I was a struggling assistant professor hoping to get one paper published and then maybe a second one, then hoping to get tenure, and then hoping to get some people to take my topic seriously. I went into finance because my friend and coauthor Werner De Bondt was interested in finance. He and I published a paper together in 1985 in the Journal of Finance, which happened to be my first finance paper, In that same year, I also published a mental accounting paper in Marketing Science.* Had you asked me at that time which field I would likely pursue, I would in fact have put all of my money on marketing, not finance. Blessed with hindsight it is easy to understand the success of behavioral finance. I would say it is explained by two things. First, there is fabulous data, the envy of every branch of economics. We have daily price data going back to 1926, for example. Second, the efficient market hypothesis that underlies most finance theory provides crisp, testable hypotheses that can serve as the null hypothesis for empirical tests. And conveniently many of those hypotheses turn out to be wrong. Compare finance to macroeconomics. Although there seems to be a wealth of data, with new numbers being announced daily, when it comes to things like market crashes or even recessions there are very few. As for crisp null hypotheses, well those are hard to come by as well, unless you include the idea that in recessions wages will fall so that there See De Bondt and Thaler (1985).

Dont get me wrong there are many psychologists in academic marketing departments but they tend to be straight psychologists, not behavioral economists, and there are plenty of economists, but few of them have a behavioral bent. I still think there is a lot of work to do in the space between those two camps and I hope more young academics enter that field. I then accidentally ended up writing three papers about game shows. That was never a part of any plan. I met some Dutch guys that had this dataset from the show \"Deal or No Deal.\" The show is just like an economics experiment except that the stakes, at least in the Dutch show, is that each player was playing for an expected value of $360,000.92 How about that as a research budget? Then we studied another show that ended witha prisoner's dilemma, and I think the prizes paid out there were about three million pounds.\" So, I think I've been opportunistic, and I work on what amuses me. Another paper of mine was about the National Football League (NFL). It is maybe one of my best papers and, in some ways, I think it's one of the most important. It gets at this idea from economists, like for instance Gary Becker, that it doesn't matter if 90% of the people at a firm can't do probabilities; the 10% who can will be in the jobs where it matters. Now, I think to some extent that's true in the investment business, because if you really don't understand probabilities you won't last very long. But it's certainly not true in the NFL and likely not true in a lot of public companies either. The idea that firms must be maximizing profits because otherwise they would be out of business isnt quite right. There are a lot of companies out there that are poorly managed, and there aren't enough people who know Bayes' rule to fill all the jobs where it's required in order for the firm to truly be maximizing profits.

This same rationale means that even for economies which have passed the worst on Covid-19, relaxing social distancing is unlikely to mean complete abolishment.

Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA When Social Distancing Is the New Normal What is the state of play with Covid-19 in Ax]? In our last report Asia Economics: If China Is First In, First Out, ls Korea or the Rest of Ax) Next? (April 8) we highlighted four groups of economies in Ax) (Exhibit 3). Wave 1 China: Daily new cases peaked in the first half of February and total confirmed cases net of those discharged/recovered peaked in mid-February (Exhibit 6). Wave 2 Korea: About 3-4 weeks behind China in Covid-19 developments. Daily new cases peaked in early March and total confirmed cases net of those discharged/recovered peaked around mid-March (Exhibit 37). Wave 3 Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand: These economies are about 2-4 weeks behind Korea in terms of Covid-19 developments. Daily new cases appear to have peaked in late March and total confirmed cases net of those discharged/recovered show signs of peaking in early April (Exhibit 56, Exhibit 21 and Exhibit 63). Wave 4& India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines: In these economies, daily confirmed cases have not shown a discernible trend of having peaked (Exhibit 29, Exhibit 60, Exhibit 48, Exhibit 61 and Exhibit 62). Where daily new cases have not peaked, containment measures have gotten more strict recently\nDaily new cases have not peaked in five out of 10 Ax) economies: India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Containment measures have been extended/tightened over the past 7-10 days (Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2). India: Extended its 21-day nationwide lockdown to 40 days, till May 3. However, it allowed activities such as manufacturing, food processing, and infrastructure to resume in rural areas where there were no hot spots but under strict norms of social distancing. Indonesia: Tightened its large-scale social restrictions in Jakarta city, including shutting down most offices and all public facilities, limiting public transport operations, and banning gatherings of more than five people. Such restrictions have also been expanded to Greater Jakarta. Singapore: Policymakers also stepped up enforcement of its circuit-breaker, levying fines on first-time offenders, tightening the list of essential services companies still operating, and closing off selected public areas. The Philippines: Further extended its lockdown of Luzon from April 12 to April 30. Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Malaysia: Extended its nationwide lockdown for a second time by another two weeks, till April 28 but allowed selected industries to reopen in stages (from April 15-28), subject to government approval and adherence to strict operating procedure with regards to health guidelines. Where daily new cases have peaked, containment rollback is at varying stages For the other five economies where there has already been a peak in new cases (China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand), we probably need to distinguish between the type of containment measures earlier undertaken. China: There had been a Lockdown, but it had already been Lifted, replaced by softer social distancing. Soft social distancing includes measures such as having different workshifts, flexible working hours, telecommuting for workplaces in mid- to high-risk regions, crowd control in mid- to high-risk regions, keeping enclosed entertainment/leisure venues closed, and keeping indoor tourist sites closed whilst allowing outdoor tourist sites to open, subject to keeping visitors to 30% of capacity. In other economies such as Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan which undertook soft containment measures but no lockdown, any degree of scale-back is likely to be less pronounced. At this point, policymakers comments on scaling back existing social distancing measures have also been mixed. Korea: The President had commented about possible relaxation if there's no rebound in infection after elections. Daily new cases would also need to fall to below 50 and cases of unknown infection to below 5% of new cases, so as not to overwhelm medical resources. One potential source of concern, though, is the recent rise in number of cases of recovered Covid-19 patients, who have retested positive Exhibit 1). Taiwan: The Ministry of Health and Welfare commented that there is no timeline for relaxing containment measures and that measures could be relaxed when there is quick screening and a vaccine. The Central Epidemic Command Centre also recently released new guidelines on capacity control for crowded places. Hong Kong: The Centre for Health Protection commented that the recent decline in daily new cases in Hong Kong does not mean that the outbreak is controlled. Public health officials and executive council members have suggested that another 1-3 weeks are required to fully ascertain the situation. In fact, Hong Kong further extended restrictions on gatherings of more than four persons and expanded the list of venues to be closed. Thailand: The two provinces of Nonthaburi and Udon Thani have announced that they are aiming to loosen the partial lockdowns as soon as April 18.

{"text": "For economies with Lockdown measures, gradual and selective reopening of sectors with strict public health guidelines is likely the next-step before policymakers progress to steady-state social distancing measures to balance between allowing for economic activities to go on without risking Covid-19 spread (Exhibit 1). Indeed, the same rationale means that even in economies which have passed the worst point in the Covid-19 situation, relaxing social distancing is unlikely to mean complete abolishment but rather, adopting measures to balance between growth and the public health threat. In our view, lockdown measures in Asia and rest of world would exert the sharpest drag on growth in 1Q20 for China and 2Q20 for the rest of AxJ. We think Ax) is likely to slow in waves, with China seeing its worst in 1Q20 whilst rest of Ax] sees its worst in 2Q20 (Exhibit 80). Indeed, real time indicators which we publish on a weekly basis for Ax) corroborate this view. China: Economic activities have bounced off the lows in February and channel checks by our China teams suggest that as of end-March, production had returned to 85%-95% of normal levels, the services sector had rebounded to 75%-85%, and services consumption was back to 50%-55% (Exhibit 19 and Exhibit 20). The rest of AxJ: Macro indicators have mostly weakened further or stabilized at low levels. Traffic congestion and usage of public transport have fallen most in economies which currently have lockdown measures in place (Exhibit 7 to Exhibit 12). Hong Kong: There's some pickup in movement, with usage of public transport and citymapper mobility index edging up from previous lows and some reduction in flight cancellations from earlier peaks. However, asset prices are slow to follow, with property prices edging lower into negative territory (Exhibit 21 to Exhibit 28). India: Macro indicators such as weekly bank credit, car sales, GST collection, and unemployment rate have continued to weaken. They are likely to get weaker with the Lockdown extension (Exhibit 29 to Exhibit 36). Korea: Daily exports in the first 10 days of April declined further from the last 10 days in March, dragged lower by subdued global demand. Meanwhile, the %YoY declines in moviegoers, weekly air passengers, Jeju tourist arrivals, and reduction in public transport usage have stabilized at low levels (Exhibit 37 to Exhibit 47)Exhibit 37Exhibit 47. Singapore: The implementation of the circuit breaker means that indicators such as public transport usage, citymapper mobility index, and traffic congestion have gone to a new low (Exhibit 48 to Exhibit 55). Taiwan: Road conditions are still less congested than usual. Usage of public transport has also not turned around, and the number of furloughed workers has picked up (Exhibit 56 to Exhibit 59). Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA ASEAN 4&: We are seeing low road congestion Levels (Lowest in the Philippines, Less so in Jakarta and Bangkok) and flight cancellations remaining at high rates. In Thailand, daily international tourist arrivals have slowed to a crawl, and a recent survey by the Department of Statistics in Malaysia suggests that 47% of self-employed have lost jobs and more than a third of self-employed report income losses exceeding 90% (Exhibit 60 to Exhibit 79).", "tokens": 526, "label": "heavy"}

Executive Council member Lam Ching Choi has suggested the ban on public gathering be extended until May 25, and that another two to three weeks is needed to assess the outbreak before considering any relaxation in restrictions. Public health officials have also commented that the recent decline in daily new confirmed cases does not mean that the outbreak is controlled in Hong Kong, and another one to two weeks would be needed to fully reflect the situation. Amid the extension of the nationwide lockdown to May 3, the Home Ministry announced on April 15 that the government will allow several activities in rural areas to resume on April 20, including farming, manufacturing, food processing industries, and infrastructure building, to provide relief to workers affected by the coronavirus lockdown. Restrictions on movement of goods by roads, and on port and air cargo operations, will also be lifted. This relaxation will be introduced only in those rural areas where there were no Covid-19 containment zones or hot spots, and the business activities would have to be carried out under strict norms of social distancing. The Health Ministry has asked states to classify districts which have reported a higher number of cases as hot spots, districts where cases have been reported as non-hot spots, and green zones where no cases have been reported. 170 hot spot districts and 207 non-hot spots have been identified as of April 15. President Jokowi has declared the Covid-19 outbreak a non-natural national disaster in a Presidential Decree, granting the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) a greater degree of authority and flexibility to mitigate the disaster. This came after the President was informed that confirmed coronavirus cases had been detected in all provinces across the country.", "tokens": 301, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Currently, policymakers aim to increase the number of Covid-19 tests to 10,000 per day. With the extended intensive social distancing period coming to an end on April 19, policymakers are increasingly discussing a potential transition into \"daily quarantine routine,\" with more sustainable long-term guidelines. While authorities remain cautious in urging continued alertness and stressing that such a transition does not mean immediate return to pre- Covid-19 normalcy, a committee was set up on April 10 in order to discuss the possibility and manner of such transition. On the same day, President Moon said that Korea may be able to shift to the daily quarantine routine if there is no rebound in infections through Easter and the general elections on April 15. Policymakers had stated on April 4 that the purpose of intensive social distancing measures is to curb the new cases to below 50 a day, the level routinely manageable by Korea's health system. They also stated a goal to reduce the number of infection cases of unknown route as much as possible. Specifically, on April 13, KCDC Director Jung specified the criteria to be less than 5% of total infected cases over a two- to four-week time period. The government announced that it will allow selected industries - e.g., automotive, hardware, electrical and electronic stores, machinery and equipment, aerospace, science, professional and technical services, social healthcare, and social healthcare - to reopen in stages in the third phase of the movement control order (MCO), starting from April 15 to 28. Companies in these sectors would need to submit their application to MITI for approval to reopen. A strict standard operating procedure that observes health guidelines will be issued for these industries as they reopen. That said, the government has rescinded its earlier decision to allow hairdressers, beauty salons, and optometrists to operate during the third phase of the MCO. Policymakers have announced that they are considering the option of extending the lockdown for another 15 days as well as deliberating the protocols to be implemented when Luzon transitions from a lockdown to a community-based quarantine. In particular, policymakers will identify the industries, the proportion of workers/work force, and the transport sectors that they will allow to slowy operate. They also added that they will set very strict and stringent guidelines on what the new normal is, which will include measures such as wearing of masks, social distancing, physical distancing, personal hygiene, etc. Meanwhile, policymakers also suggested that the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) may be eased into a \"selective\" quarantine if the Philippines sees an increase in health capacity and recovery rate and a decrease in fatality rate. Specifically, the selective and gradual lifting of the ECQ will be based on a \"rolling restart\" and \"rolling reopening\" scheme. A locality assessed to be suitable for partial or gradual lifting of restrictions will be selected based on metrics, such as the viral spread, new cases, deaths, recoveries, the testing capacity and healthcare capacities, and human resources. Policymakers cited Valenzuela City, Pasig City, and Cavite province as among the areas under quarantine that have a good chance of having some of their restrictions removed, depending on their respective circumstances. Policymakers announced that life will not \"revert to normal\" when the circuit breaker (CB) ends on 4 May, and that it could be extended if necessary. Even if the circuit breaker were to end, the significantly stricter CB measures would not be lifted at once. The measures may be tightened, loosened, or fine-tuned.", "tokens": 581, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "For measures that are relaxed, policymakers announced that this will be part of a gradual process that will extend beyond the CB period. The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) had announced Phase 1 of social distancing measures on April 1 to encourage the general public, in phases, to maintain social etiquette and observe social distancing. The CECC had added that in the second phase, which will commence if and when circumstances require, it will institute mandatory rules. All nonessential events, particularly those of an entertainment nature, will be prohibited. The mandatory rules will specify separate social distancing standards for restaurants, school campuses, offices, mass transport, supermarkets, other commercial sites, locations with long lines of waiting people, and special institutions such as long-term care facilities and prisons. Having suspended operations of clubs and ballrooms on April 9 and imposed crowd control at tourist attractions on April 10 following the four-day Tomb Sweeping Day, the Minister of Health and Welfare said it is unlikely there would be large-scale community transmission in Taiwan on April 13. However, Taiwan remains in an observation phase and there is currently no timeline for relaxing of containment measures. He added that it is very possible that only when there is quick screening and vaccine can measures be relaxed. In Thailand, provincial governors have the authority to adjust curbs. Two provinces, Nonthaburi and Udon Thani, have announced that they are aiming to loosen the partial lockdowns as soon as April 18. Specifically, the Udon Thani governor has announced that if there are no new virus cases in the 14 days through April 17, the province will start relaxing rules, e.g. allowing people to dine at restaurants, but with social distancing guidelines. Meanwhile, the PM has announced that the government will consider whether to ease the current nationwide curfew restrictions or extend the nationwide state of emergency, with the review to take place during the last week of April as policymakers consider alternative measures to flatten the curve of infections. He also commented that if the government eases the rules, it will be gradual, not all at once, and that measures to prevent a second wave of infections must be put in place. He added that all businesses need to be ready with preventive measures when they reopen.

With the widespread testing program, the authorities are able to identify infected people, isolate them and trace their contacts with other people, who then also could be tested. This helps to minimize further spread and also quickly treat those found with the virus. - Under the intensive social distancing campaign (first introduced for 15 days on March 21 and then subsequently extended for another two weeks), the government strongly urged the public to delay/cance!l nonessential gatherings and refrain from going out as much as possible. All employees are urged to go home directly after work and stay home if sick, while all employers are encouraged to adopt work from home, flexible work hours, etc. outh Korea - Apart from public libraries, museums, and galleries which were already closed, the government strongly urged religious and certain indoor sports/entertainment facilities (and other facilities local governments may deem as dangerous), which are deemed susceptible to cluster infections, to stop operation during the period. The government announced that it would conduct close inspections of such facilities if they choose to operate, and that it would fine/force closure if they are found to be violating the specific sets of safety rules. The government also warned that it would pursue legal actions in case of contagion at these places for associated costs. Taiwan: Combination of pre-emptive actions, comprehensive testing and contact tracing for early detection; introduction of social distancing measures\nTaiwan - The government adopted a combination of early vigilance, proactive measures, pervasive screening and comprehensive testing, contact tracing, and information sharing with the public as well as applying technology, e.g., analyzing big data to track where infected people have been and online platforms to inform people where face masks are currently available. - While no lockdown or hard domestic containment measures are in place, Taiwan was fast to adopt restrictions on incoming foreigners, starting with suspension of tourists from Wuhan on January 23 and ban on entry of Chinese nationals on February 6. As of March 19, entry of most foreigners was banned, and all transit flights were banned from March 24. - On March 31, the government introduced a set of rules on social distancing under which the public is urged to keep at least 1m apart outdoors and 1.5m apart indoors. The government urged the public to avoid social gatherings which require close interactions with others, and to wear masks if the 1m/1.5m distancing cannot be followed. The public is also required to wear masks on public transportation, and the venues which cannot abide by these rules should close. Hong Kong: ressive Covid-19 testing and contact tracing, large-scale social distancing measures Hong Kong - The government has restricted non-HK residents who have been to Hubei in the past 14 days from entering Hong Kong since January. - The government has closed its borders to all non-residents since 24 March until further notice. It has implemented a compulsory 14-day home quarantine arrangement to people arriving in Hong Kong who have been to any overseas countries in the past 14 days since 19 March.

In particular, provinces, cities and regencies may only implement large-scale social restrictions, and they cannot implement regional quarantines or close their borders. . - Jakarta was the first city to be granted approval by the Health Ministry (on April 7) to impose large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) in the city. The Jakarta governor has announced that tighter social distancing measures to limit people's\nIndonesia movement will take effect from April 10 and last for 14 days, including shutting down most offices and all public facilities, limiting public transport operations, and banning gathering of more than five people. The rules will be enforced strictly and the duration can be extended if needed. - Subsequently, the implementation of PSBB has been expanded from only Jakarta city into Greater Jakarta, which also includes the satellite cities. Specifically, five areas in West Java - i.e. the cities of Depok, Bekasi, and Bogor, as well as Bekasi and Bogor regencies - have received approval from the health ministry to implement PSBB status from April 15 for 14 days. Meanwhile, the West Java Governor announced that his administration is submitting a PSBB request for Greater Bandung, which includes Bandung and Cimahi cities, as well as Bandung, West Bandung, and Sumedang regencies.

All are encouraged to stay at home, and only go out if necessary. Singapore - During the CB period, only essential services that support daily needs (e.g., all food and beverage outlets, supermarkets, healthcare, social services, banking and financial services) will remain open, with safe-distancing measures in place. All workplaces, except for those in essential services and key economic sectors, schools, and retail outlets, will be closed. Employers that are able to continue to operate their businesses with their employees working from home can continue to do so. - The government has since tightened the implementation of the CB measures, through levying fines for all offenders (including first-timers) breaking the CB rules, stepping up enforcement effort, making it mandatory to wear masks in public, tightening the list of companies under essential services that are still operating, and closing off selected areas in parks and natural reserves, as well as all beaches and stadiums.", "tokens": 510, "label": "heavy"}

Preventing a total collapse of the financial sys- tem necessitated bail-outs and an unprecedentedly accommodative monetary policy. To avoid a recurrence, policy makers introduced new rules in a bid to increase banks resilience against\nshocks and to make the financial system safer. Higher capital requirements have emerged as the most prominent tool: new regulation such as Basel III or regulatory stress tests prescribes significantly higher capital ratios for banks. These measures, and stress tests in particular, have achieved their goals of improving risk management and capital planning at individual in- stitutions, as well as promoting the stability of the financial system (Quarles, 2019). However, since many observers have expressed concern about possible unintended side effects, regulators have directed their attention towards evaluating the effects of stress tests on credit supply and the real economy.! This paper argues that U.S. stress tests have reduced the credit supply to entrepreneurs, thus contributing to the anemic recovery of young firms since the crisis. Exploiting a unique feature of geographically disaggregated data on mortgage lending, I establish that banks sub- ject to post-crisis stress tests have strongly curbed lending secured by home equity to small businesses. Since home equity lending is an important source of financing for entrepreneurs, its contraction hurts firm entry and the real economy. Counties in which stress tested banks have a higher pre-crisis market share have seen a relative decline in employment at young firms during the recovery. Importantly, employment declines by more in industries in which a higher share of young firms relies on home equity financing. I also find that counties with a higher market share of stress tested banks see a relative decline in patent applications by young firms, as well as labor productivity reflecting the outsized importance of young firms for innovation and growth (Haltiwanger, 2015). My paper provides a possible explanation for the persistent decline in entrepreneurship since the crisis. Following the financial crisis, regulators introduced annual stress tests that monitor the investment portfolios of systemically relevant banks.", "tokens": 784, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "Their primary objective is to enhance financial stability and reduce risky lending. Stress tests assume an adverse economic scenario, for example rising unemployment and falling house prices. Given banks asset portfolios, an internal model predicts banks hypothetical losses. These losses are then projected into mini- mum capital ratios for banks that would be required to withstand the downturn. If they fail a test, financial institutions must adjust their equity and may not distribute capital over the following quarters. While stress tests are a macroprudential tool designed to bolster financial\nstability, a common complaint is that they raise the cost of certain loan classes, in particular See, for example, Evaluation of the effects of financial regulatory reforms on small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing (Financial Stability Board 2019) small business lending (Bordo, Cole and Duca, 2019).* One argument is that stress tests raise costs for pro-cyclical loan classes through higher implicit risk weights (Cortes, Demyanyk, Li, Loutskina and Strahan, forthcoming). This paper argues that stress tests have unintended neg- ative side effects on small business loans secured by home equity, because they assume a strong decline in residential real estate prices and hence impose high risk weights on business-related home equity loans. The empirical analysis begins by showing that banks subject to stress tests cut loan supply to small businesses that is secured by home equity. To identify business-related home equity loans in the data, I exploit a unique feature of loan-level data on residential mortgage lending, as provided by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). In HMDA, if an applicant or co- applicant is not a natural person (i.e. the applicant is a company), banks have to report ethnicity and gender codes as not applicable (Avery, Brevoort and Canner, 2007). By focusing on refinanced loans, this allows me to isolate small business loans secured by home equity. HMDA thus provides detailed yearly data on business-related home equity lending, disaggregated at the bank-county level. To the best of my knowledge, this rich data source on business-related lending has so far been overlooked in the literature. To estimate the effect of stress tests on loan supply, I compare lending by stress tested to non-stress tested banks during the pre- and post-crisis period in a difference-in-difference setting. Granular data on the bank-county level allow me to isolate loan supply by including time-varying fixed effects at the borrower-county level that control for unobservable county characteristics, for example, loan demand. I find that stress tested banks cut business-related", "tokens": 413, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "home-equity lending by around 35.9% more than non-stress tested banks during the stress testing period. Including county*time fixed effects slightly decreases effect size, but coefficients remain economically and statistically significant suggesting that banks cut loan supply. To further separate demand and supply forces, I] compare secured with unsecured small business lending by the same bank. Using balance sheet data at the aggregate bank level, I show that small business lending does not decline uniformly. While stress tested banks cut unsecured loans by an (insignificant) 12% relative to non-stress tested banks, they reduce small business loans secured by real estate collateral by more than three times as much. Within-bank comparisons allow me to control for time-varying confounding factors at the bank level through bank*time fixed effects. Their inclusion does not materially affect results. I argue that the fall in business-related home-equity lending is an unintended side effect of stress tests due to an ?For examples, see How Dodd-Frank Stole The Recovery By Killing Small-Business Growth (Investors Business Daily), How the Dodd-Frank Act hurts small businesses (The Washington Post), and Dodd-Frank has made banks safer but slowed economy, data show (Financial Times). The importance of stress tests for lending is in line with a recent survey by the MIT Golub Center, in which senior officers of large banks report that post-crisis financial regulation, and in particular stress tests, are the main determinants of changes in their post-crisis risk management practices (See MIT GCFP and GrantThompson (2017): The risk management function of the future .) assumed collapse in house prices, which although aimed at addressing risk in the residential mortgage market constitutes an additional cost for secured small business loans. In a second step, I analyze the consequences of the decline in credit supply for the real\neconomy. For each U.S. county, I define pre-crisis exposure to stress tested banks as the share of county deposits held in branches of stress tested banks. Exposure reflects geographic variation in the importance of stress tested banks in local markets across the U.S. I first establish that ageregate business-related home-equity lending declines in exposed counties in other words, non-stress tested banks do not make up for the contraction in secured small business loans by stress tested banks. Then, using detailed county by industry by age data on firm employment, I show that counties with higher exposure see a significant decline in employment among young firms during the post-crisis period, relative to counties with low exposure. Young firms are opaque and inherently risky, and often rely on personal assets to secure loans (Steijvers and Voordeckers, 2009). Consequently, I find that the strong contraction in small business lending secured by home equity disproportionately affects industries in which home equity financing is more important. Using the 2007 Survey of Business Owners I compute the industry share of young firms that use home equity or personal assets to start or expand their business. Within industries in the top tercile of home equity dependence, the negative effect of exposure on entrepreneurship is almost three times as large as for industries in the bottom tercile. In home equity-intensive industries, counties at the 75 percentile of exposure see a 0.8% stronger decline in the share of young firm employment, relative to counties at the 25 percentile. For the average county, the share of young firm employment out of total employment declined by 2.1% relative to the pre-crisis period. The employment decline in high-exposure counties hence corresponds to around one-third of the average cross-sectional decline.", "tokens": 581, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The empirical analysis faces various challenges. I argue that stress tests are responsible for the decline in HMDA home equity loans, in line with findings on small business lending by Berrospide and Edge (2019) and Cortes, Demyanyk, Li, Loutskina and Strahan (forthcoming). Since the post-crisis period is riddled with regulatory initiatives and government programs, I undertake additional tests to isolate the role of stress tests. First, I restrict the sample to banks with at least $20bn in assets. Narrowing the control group does not materially affect results. Second, I show that secured and unsecured bank loans follow the same trend prior to the crisis for stress tested banks, and that there is also no differential pre-trend across stress tested and non-stress tested banks. Third, within the sample of stress tested banks I use the quasi-exogenous capital gap computed in Cortes, Demyanyk, Li, Loutskina and Strahan (forth- coming) between forecasted and regulatory minimum capital ratio and show that banks facing a smaller capital gap have a significantly lower growth rate of business-related home equity lend- 3The share exhibits little variation across survey vintages. 4 ing from 2012 to 2016. Finally, I compute a measure of county risk and find that the decline in lending by stress tested banks is stronger in riskier counties. This specification allows for the inclusion of bank*time fixed effects, so that unobservable time-varying bank characteristics are not confounding effects. Coefficients remain stable under saturated specifications. On the county level, the key challenge for identification is to control for unobservable shocks that affect young firms and are correlated with county exposure to stress tested banks. I overcome this issue by including granular fixed effects. County*industry fixed effects exploit variation within the same county-industry pair over time and control for unobservable and time-invariant county and industry heterogeneity. County*time fixed effects allow shocks to affect each county at each point in time heterogeneously. Thereby I control for unobservable time-varying county fundamentals (such as house prices or unemployment). In addition to local shocks, industry-specific changes, for example the secular decline in manufacturing or changes in export competition, could affect young firms. Inclusion of industry*time fixed effects mitigates these concerns. Essentially, | am comparing employment at young firms in the same county and same industry for different levels of exposure and home equity dependence, exploiting only the within variation of each county-industry pair (Jimenez, Ongena, Peydre and Saurina, 2014). Estimated coefficients remain significant after adding the battery of fixed effects; if anything, effect size increases, which suggests that stress tested banks serve counties with stronger unobservables during the recovery. In addition, I use an instrumental variable (IV) approach that predicts county exposure to stress tested banks with a gravity model of bank expansion, combined with staggered state level deregulation of interstate banking from 1994 to 2005. he instrument addresses the issue that banks distribution of deposits could reflect strategic choices. Building on a large literature highlighting the importance of distance in banking (Degryse and Ongena, 2005; Agarwal and Hauswald, 2010), in a first step I predict banks geographic distribution of deposits\nacross counties. | employ a gravity model based on the distance between banks headquarters and branch counties, as well as relative market size (Goetz, Laeven and Levine, 2013, 2016). Since the gravity model disregards state level policies on banking deregulation, in a second step I re-scale predicted deposits with an index of staggered interstate banking deregulation (Rice and Strahan, 2010). Re-scaling takes into account that, to different degrees, states have restricted out-of-state banks from entering. To the extent that distance and deregulation prior to 2005 are plausibly exogenous to county characteristics during the recovery, I use exposure based on predicted and deregulation-adjusted deposits as an instrument for observed exposure. IV regressions confirm OLS estimates and show that higher exposure significantly reduces employment at young firms.", "tokens": 634, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "IV coefficients are similar in terms of sign and significance to OLS, but larger in magnitude. The increase in magnitude is in line with fixed effects regressions if the instrument addresses the issues that stress tested banks select into counties with stronger (unobservable) fundamentals. In further robustness checks on the county level, I show that neither the pre-crisis housing boom, nor the decline of house prices during the recession, nor variation in home ownership across counties explain the results. As results are robust to factors related to the housing mar- ket, this rules out demand-driven explanations based on the collateral channel. Furthermore, when I control for industry risk or account for differences in the sensitivity of young and old firms to common shocks through fixed effects, results remain close to their baseline values. This suggests that any changes in risk among borrowers are not responsible for my findings. Likewise, controlling for the share of the four largest banks or restricting the sample to coun- ties with no top-four presence does not materially affect results. Finally, I compute exposure based on CRA loan data instead of deposit data.", "tokens": 187, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Results are similar in terms of sign, size, and significance. After establishing that banks cut their loan supply to entrepreneurs, who in turn employ fewer workers, I show that exposure to stress tested banks also negatively affects innovation. Using data on U.S. patents aggregated to the county level, I find that county exposure to stress tested banks has a strong and significant negative effect on innovation at young firms. Over the post-crisis period, counties at the 75 percentile of exposure see a 16% decline in patent applications by young firms, relative to counties at the 25 percentile.* There is no significant effect on patenting activity by old firms. The negative effect of exposure to stress tested banks on patenting of young firms increases in magnitude when I account for the quality of innovation by citation-weighting patents; this suggests that more productive firms get less financing. In light of recent literature establishing that young firms contribute disproportionately to aggregate productivity growth (Haltiwanger, 2015; Alon, Berger, Pugsley and Dent, 2018) and the debate on the post-crisis productivity slowdown (Teulings and Baldwin, 2014; Fer- nald, 2016), my results raise the question whether regulation exacerbates these macroeconomic trends. I provide suggestive evidence that stress tests have negatively affected labor produc- tivity during the recovery. Similar to findings for young firm employment, wages (a common proxy for labor productivity) decline significantly more in exposed counties and industries with higher reliance on home equity financing. This suggests that stress testing, through its effect on loan supply and entrepreneurship, could have slowed recovery from the recession. My results do not imply that stress testing is bad for welfare in general. Stress testing seeks to to reduce risk-taking and bolster financial stability. Reducing volatility and the incidence of crises might require a reduction in risky lending to young firms. This paper highlights a possible trade-off between financial stability and growth: post-crisis financial regulation leads to a reallocation of credit away from risky borrowers, and these unintended side effects have reduced dynamism and innovation during the recovery from the Great Recession.

{"text": "* Accounting for the importance of patents and weighting by citations increases effect size. Literature and Contribution The main contribution lies in providing an explanation for the persistent decline in entrepreneurship since the crisis. I thereby highlight a quantitatively important channel through which stress tests affect the real economy: they prevent young firms from getting credit and have unintended negative side effects on innovation and growth. My paper speaks to two strands of literature. First, it connects to work that analyzes the effects of regulation, in particular stress testing, on loan supply. Several recent papers suggest that stress tests increase implicit capital requirements on riskier loans. Berrospide and Edge (2019) and Bordo, Cole and Duca (2019) show that stress tests reduce banks C&I and small business lending. Cortes, Demyanyk, Li, Loutskina and Strahan (forthcoming) use banks capital gap in each stress test, i.e. the distance of forecasted from required minimum capital ratio, and show that within the group of stress tested banks, those with smaller gaps reduce credit supply of and raise interest rates on small business loans. For large borrowers and syndicated loans, Acharya, Berger and Roman (2018) and Pierret and Steri (2018) show that banks act more prudently when subject to stress tests. Since young firms are inherently risky and require external finance to grow (Steijvers and Voordeckers, 2009; Ivashina and Scharfstein, 2010), my finding that stress tests reduce credit supply to risky borrowers is in line with previous findings. However, relative to the existing literature, this paper makes two main contributions. First, I establish sizeable real effects of regulation, while the results in previous literature on the effects of stress tests on employment or investment are ambiguous. By focusing on the crucial role of home equity lending as a source of financing for young firms, I show that stress tests have an economically meaningful effect on entrepreneurship and innovation. Second, I construct a novel dataset on home equity lending to businesses on the granular bank-county level. A large literature analyses how home equity 7 and the collateral channel matter for businesses. Most papers rely on changes in aggregate\nhouse prices to indirectly infer the effect on firms borrowing against real estate collateral. Disaggregated data on business-related home equity loans at the bank-county level provide complementary direct evidence on lending and help to disentangle demand and supply forces. For further papers on regulation and bank resolution, see Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004); Aiyar, Calomiris, Hooley, Korniyenko and Wieladek (2014); Fraisse, Le and Thesmar (2015); Jimenez, Ongena, Peydre and Saurina (2017); Granja and Leuz (2017); Gropp, Rocholl and Saadi (2017); Celerier, Kick and Ongena (2018); Connolly (2018); Gropp, Mosk, Ongena and Wix (2018); Shapiro and Zeng (2018); De Jonghe, Dewachter, Mulier, Ongena and Schepens (2019). A related paper is Chen, Hanson and Stein (2017), who document that the four largest U.S. banks contract their small business lending during and after the crisis. They also show that counties with a higher market share see a persistent drop in wage growth, despite the fact that employment rebounds. Bord, Ivashina and Taliaferro (2018) focus on the exposure of large banks the the collapse in real estate prices and show that banks with higher exposure contract small business lending by more. For real effects, they document that there is weaker employment growth among small firms in the post-crisis period. My results provide a complementary explanation: post-crisis financial regulation hurts entrepreneurs and thereby productivity.

Siemer (2016); Moreira (2017) and Bassetto, Cagetti and De Nardi (2015) show that the decline in young firm employment during the Great Recession has lasting effects on growth.

While there is convincing evidence that dynamism and growth have declined, there is little consensus on the underlying forces that are responsible. I provide a supply-side explanation for the anemic recovery from the Great Recession, based on cross-sectional evidence: changes in bank lending hurt start-ups above and beyond the immediate effects during the crisis.

Their goal is to assess whether banks can withstand adverse shocks, including rising unemployment and falling house prices. Regulators provide banks with three scenarios: baseline, adverse, and severely adverse. Each scenarlo simulates an increasingly hostile economic environment. For example, the severely adverse scenario in 2014 stress tests assumes a rise in the unemployment rate to 12% and a fall 8The post-crisis slowdown in growth led to a debate on whether advanced economies have entered a period of secular stagnation, see Summers (2015); Gordon (2015).

The thresholds were chosen such that stress tests cover the largest and systemically relevant financial institutions in the U.S. banking system. Stress tests are seen as effective in altering banks lending behavior to reduce risk. For example, both regulators and the senior officers of large banks agree that a large portion of [why banks implemented risk management practices after the financial crisis] is driven by |...] regulations and that stress tests were effective, but costly .\"! However, small businesses and banks have complained that stress tests reduce banks ability to supply credit to small firms. The Clearinghouse, a banking association and payments com- pany owned by the largest commercial banks, argues that the Federal Reserves CCAR stress test is imposing dramatically higher capital requirements on [...] small business loans (Clear- inghouse, 2017a). In a similar vein, the National Small Business Association states lending is much harder than it was before the great recession. There are two main reasons why small business loans are particularly sensitive to stress tests. First, small business employment is pro-cyclical and depends on local demand, which makes it sensitive to changes in aggregate macroeconomic conditions and hence riskier under adverse scenarios. Since banks can loosen their capital requirement by reducing risk in their loan portfolio, small business lending be- comes more expensive for stress tested banks (Bordo, Cole and Duca, 2019; Cortes, Demyanyk, Li, Loutskina and Strahan, forthcoming). Second, young and small firms are risky and opaque, often with no credit history. To overcome asymmetric information about borrower quality, banks require collateral (Carpenter and Petersen, 2002; Berger, Espinosa-Vega, Frame and Miller, 2011; Berger and Bouwman, 2013; Berger, Imbierowicz and Rauch, 2016). Stress tests model a strong decline in house prices (collateral values) in addition to declining economic activity (weak local demand). Secured small business lending is thus not only assumed to\nbe inherently pro-cyclical, but subject to both declining demand and falling collateral values, Since 2013, the Federal Reserve can give an objection, a conditional non-objection, or a non-objection to a banks capital plans.

Note that the modeled decline in residential real estate prices aims at addressing risk in the residential mortgage market. While bank lending is an important source of financing for young firms, loans to young firms and especially business-related home equity loans constitute only a tiny share of overall bank lending. Its impact on aggregate bank risk is therefore negligible; the effect of stress tests on business-related home equity lending likely reflects an unintended side effect, rather than the explicit goal. Bank Data The bank level analyzes how stress tests affect banks loan supply to small busi- nesses, in particular when loans are secured by real estate collateral. he Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides detailed bank balance sheet data in its Statistics on Depository Institutions (SDI), as well as information on secured and unsecured small busi- ness loans. I define small business loans as loans outstanding with an origination amount of $1,000,000 or less. Secured commercial loans are defined as Nonresidential loans (excluding farm loans) primarily secured by real estate held in domestic offices, and exclude loans for construction purposes. Each bank is assigned a dummy with value one if its bank holding company (BHC) is mandated to undergo stress tests. To control for annual differences in bank characteristics, I collect second quarter data for each year on banks total assets, Tier 1 capital ratio, non-interest and total income, total investment securities, overhead costs (efficiency ra- tio), non-performing loans, share of C&I loans, return on assets, interest expense on deposits, and total deposits. Since SDI provide data on the bank-time level, controlling for loan demand is imperfect. For example, stress tested banks could lend to counties with less overall demand for loans, in which case it is difficult to disentangle the effect of regulation on loan supply from changes in local demand. To analyze the loan supply effects of stress tests on secured commercial loans, I exploit a feature of loan-level data on residential mortgage lending, provided by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.

Further, since HMDA has poor coverage in rural areas, I restrict the sample to borrowers located in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). After merging HMDA data with data on bank balance sheets and county characteristics, I end up with a sample of 169,061 bank-county-year observations, in which 3,195 banks serve 2,373 counties. he average year has 11,953 bank-county observations. | Table 1 about here | Table 1, panels (a)-(b), report mean, standard deviation (sd), and additional statistics for key bank variables for the full sample from 2002-2016.

First, I establish that stress tested banks reduce lending to small businesses secured by home equity, building on the fact that stress tests increase banks cost of lending to small firms (Acharya, Berger and Roman, 2018; Cortes, Demyanyk, Li, Loutskina and Strahan, forthcoming). In a second step, I show that the reduction in credit supply to small businesses hurts entrepreneurs: counties with higher exposure to stress tested banks see a weaker recovery of employment at young firms, because entrepreneurs lack credit.! This step build on the assumptions that a) almost all young firms are small; b) young firms rely on bank financing and collateral; and c) substituting across banks or into other forms of lending is subject to frictions. These assumptions are well-established in the literature: more than 90% of start-ups have fewer than 20 employees (Haltiwanger, 2015). Carpenter and Petersen (2002) show that small firms are financially 13 3.1 Stress Tests and Home Equity Lending I first establish on the bank-county-year level that stress tested banks reduce small business lending secured by home equity financing (henceforth secured small business lending) by more than non-stress tested banks. To estimate how stress tested banks adjust their lending relative to other banks during the recovery, I run the following panel specification from 2002 to 2016: hmda In(amt)ycr = stress tested), + control sy +1 + 0,6 + Tet + bt; (3) where In(amt),.4 denotes log volume of HMDA home equity loans to small businesses by bank b to county c in year t. stress tested is a dummy with value one for each year a bank is undergoing stress tests, and zero otherwise. For example, banks that were stress tested from 2009 onward get value one for each stress tests on from 2009, while banks that were added to the group of stress tested banks by 2014 get value zero for all years prior to 2014, and value one from then on. Bank controls include log of total assets, return on assets, deposits to total assets, Tier 1 capital ratio, overhead costs, share of non-performing loans in total loans, the share of non-interest income, C&I loans over total loans, and bank liquidity (cash plus marketable securities over assets). All controls are lagged by one period to avoid endogeneity. Standard errors are clustered on the bank holding company (BHC) level to account for serial correlation. Each regression includes bank*county (4%,-) fixed effects and exploits variation within each bank-county combination, relative to its average. This gives equation (3) an interpretation in\nhmda < () indicates that stress tested banks reduce lending by more than terms of changes: 7 non-stress tested banks, relative to their respective pre-crisis trends. I also include time (7;) fixed effects to account for common shocks. hmda in regression equation (3) reflects changes in banks loan supply, but also Coefficient ~y loan demand. In counties where stress tested banks extend more loans small firms could de- mand less credit for reasons unrelated to stress testing. For example, a natural disaster or changes in zoning laws could reduce loan demand and lending, irrespective of bank perfor- mance. Disaggregated bank-county data allow me to include county*time fixed effects (7.4) that absorb any unobserved changes in borrower characteristics across counties. In other words, with county*time fixed effects I compare lending by bank b to the same county. Under the assumption that small businesses depend on local demand, including county*time fixed ef fects isolates changes in loan supply. Comparing coefhicients with and without county fixed effects thus provides insights on magnitude and direction of the bias arising from imperfectly constrained, and Steijvers and Voordeckers (2009) report that 53% of loans granted to small firms use personal collateral, that the share is even higher for young and risky firms, and that young firms have limited outside financing options. Bolton et al. (2016) show the importance of relationship lending for small firms. 20A specification in levels with fixed effects is also better suited to capture the cumulative effect of stress tests over a span of multiple years, rather than their immediate impact on growth in a given year. 14 controlling for county characteristics. | Table 2 about here |\nTable 2 shows that stress tested banks reduce their supply of secured small business credit. Column (1) shows that stress tested banks reduce business-related home equity lending by 35.9% more during the stress testing period than non-stress tested banks. Effects are condi- tional on bank controls, bank*county fixed effects, and year fixed effects. To isolate changes in credit supply, column (2) introduces county*time fixed effects. The coefficient of interest keeps sign and significance, which suggests that stress tested banks reduce their loan supply. The slight decrease in coefficient size suggests that stress tested banks lend to counties with generally weaker loan demand during the post crisis period. In column (2), stress tested banks reduce small business lending by 26.7% more than non-stress tested banks. HMDA data cover a subset of banks total small business lending secured by real estate collateral. It also covers only a subset of lenders those reporting their HMDA filings. To see whether the decline in secured business loans also holds for aggregate bank lending, I use FDIC SDI data on total secured and unsecured small business lending on the bank year level. Figure 2 provides a first visual inspection of the two series in the pre- and post-crisis period. It shows that both types of loans have evolved in a strikingly different manner since the crisis.

Column (4) uses log secured business lending as dependent variable and shows a relative decline by 35.8% for stress tested banks, or more than three times as much as its unsecured counterpart.

Since then, job creation by old firms is almost back to its pre-crisis levels, while young firms have not recovered. This section links the reduction in loan supply to the decline in young firms by showing that county exposure to stress tested banks depresses entrepreneurship. Since young firms have an outsized effect on aggregate innovation and productivity, in a second step I analyze how exposure to stress tested banks affects patent applications and wages. | Figure 3 about here | I estimate regressions on the county-year (C-Y) and county-industry-year (C-I-Y) level.

The inclusion of county*industry fixed effects, combined with a dependent variable in logs, implies an interpretation in changes. The coefficient of interest (77) indicates whether counties with higher exposure see a stronger de- cline in the importance of young firms or wages (relative to counties with low exposure) in industries that rely more on home equity financing. If so, then y7 < 0. Identification fixed effects The underlying assumption in regression equations (6) and (7) is that counties with higher exposure see a relative decline in young firms and innovation because stress tested banks supply less credit to young firms. To ensure that exposure reflects loan supply effects, I need to control for confounding unobservable shocks that affect employ- ment of young firms. Regressions on the bank-county-year level allow me to isolate the relative contribution of loan supply to small business lending by controlling for county-specific loan demand. However, unobservable county or industry characteristics could still lead to a bias in county level regressions. The key identification challenge is thus to control for characteristics that affect young firms beyond the change in credit supply by stress tested banks. I overcome this issue in regression equation (7) by including granular fixed effects. First, county*industry fixed effects (@.;) exploit variation within the same county-industry combination over time and control for unobservable and time-invariant county and industry heterogeneity (for example location or sensitivity to the business cycle), as well as for unobservable time-invariant characteristics at the county-industry level, such as the importance of an industry within a county. Second, county*time fixed effects (724) allow shocks to affect each county at each point in time heterogeneously. Thereby I control for unobservable time-varying county fundamentals (such as house prices, unemployment, and other local characteristics) to identify credit supply. Third, industry*time fixed effects (7;,) absorb common shocks to two-digit industries that vary over time, for example the secular decline in manufacturing. Essentially, I am comparing employment at young firms in the same county and same industry for different levels of exposure, exploiting only the within variation of each county-industry pair (Jimenez, Ongena, Peydre and Saurina, 2014). After absorbing changes in local and industry demand, the remaining variation reflects the consequences of changes in loan supply. Identification gravity model and deregulation Identification of the effects of stress tests on entrepreneurship and innovation rests on geographical variation in exposure across counties. Exposure is constructed based on bank deposits in a given county, but banks de- posit share in a county is potentially endogenous to unobservable county characteristics for example, if stress tested banks select into counties with a weaker recovery. While granular fixed effects on the county*industry and county*year level already address concerns about selection and unobservables, I additionally instrument local bank deposits through a gravity model of 18 bank expansion (Goetz, Laeven and Levine, 2013, 2016), combined with an index of interstate banking deregulation as developed in Rice and Strahan (2010).*' Intuitively, gravity models", "tokens": 605, "label": "heavy"}

Since bank level regressions in Table 2 show that stress tested banks reduce secured small business lending by more than three times as much than unsecured small business loans, this could explain why other papers find no effect on aggregate small business lending. 21 vary over time. he negative coefficient on the triple interaction term suggests that the decline in employees of young firms is stronger in industries with a higher share of firms using home equity to start or expand operations. Including fixed effects to control for demand effects in column (5) does not change sign or significance of the coefficient of interest (note that fixed effects absorb coefficients on interaction terms between exposure, home equity, and the post dummy). However, the coefficient increases in magnitude, which suggests that counties with higher exposure have stronger fundamentals and coefficients in regressions without granular fixed effects are biased towards zero. Columns (6)-(7) instrument actual with predicted exposure. IV estimates confirm OLS findings: higher exposure to stress tested banks reduces employment among young firms, and the more so in home equity-intensive industries. IV estimates are slightly larger than OLS es- timates. In line with fixed effects specifications, this suggests that high-exposure counties have stronger fundamentals. In column (7), moving a county from the 25\" to the 75 percentile in terms of exposure leads to a relative decline in young firm employment by 11% in home equity-intensive industries. Table 4 hence shows that the contraction in business-related home equity loans by stress tested banks affects the real economy: there is a decline in aggregate credit and since young firms disproportionately depend on home equity financing, their em- ployment declines.

Restricting the sample to larger banks leaves the coefficient of interest almost identical in terms of sign, size, and significance to baseline results, alleviating concerns that bank size alone explains findings. One potential concern regarding data construction of business-related home equity lending based on HMDA is that it includes transactions by developers.

This suggests that the effect of stress testing in risky counties is orthogonal to a wide selection of unobservable and observable bank characteristics (Altonji, Elder and Taber, 2005; Oster, 2017). As mentioned above, stress tested banks are the largest banks. To tighten identification, columns (9)-(11) restrict the sample to stress tested banks over the time period 2012-2016. Within this group, stress test exposure denotes banks quasi-exogenous capital gap, i.e. the distance of forecasted from required minimum capital ratio (for details, see Cortes, Demyanyk, Li, Loutskina and Strahan (forthcoming)). Column (9) shows that among stress tested banks those that perform relatively worse in stress tests see a strong and significant decline in their erowth of home equity lending to small businesses. As I include county*time fixed effects, the contraction in loan growth reflects a decline in loan supply. Columns (10)-(11) interact stress test exposure with county risk. As for the full sample, loan growth declines by most in risky counties. Adding bank*time fixed effects to control for observable and unobservable bank characteristics reduces effect size; yet, the effect of stress test exposure on loan growth remains negative and significant at the 5% level. 24Cortes, Demyanyk, Li, Loutskina and Strahan (forthcoming) define industry betas, or industry risk, as the long-run sensitivity of industry employment to changes in aggregate employment. Higher values indicate riskier industries; likewise, higher values of county risk imply that a county is more pro-cyclical and hence riskier. 2For a one unit increase in county risk, which is close to its average value of 0.89, stress tested banks cut lending by 40.7% (54.4%) more in column (5) ((6)). 26Tn change regressions, I can no longer include bank*county fixed effects without eliminating the relevant variation. 23 County Robustness _ Tables 6 and 7 provide additional robustness checks on the county level. Literature establishes the importance of the collateral channel: rising real estate prices increase collateral values and relax financial constraints.2 While in baseline regressions county*year fixed effects control for common shocks to all firms within a county, changes in local real estate prices could affect industries heterogeneously, depending on their home equity intensity. For\nexample, if house prices recovered more slowly from the Great Recession in counties with higher exposure, depressed collateral values would decrease loan demand by more in industries that rely on home equity. Likewise, literature has shown that the pre-crisis house price boom and ensuing bust had lasting effects on local economies (Mian, Sufi and Trebbi, 2015). If the boom- bust cycle of house prices affects industries differentially based on their financing patterns, my estimates could be biased. To this end, Table 6 columns (1) and (2) include the change in county house prices from 2000 to 2007 during the boom, as well as the bust in house prices from 2007 to 2010. While both variables, interacted with home equity and the post dummy, enter significantly and with the expected sign (a more pronounced boom and bust depress young firm employment in the post-crisis period), the coefficient on exposure x home equity x 1(2009-16) remains significant and negative, and close in magnitude to the baseline specification. Similarly, including the share of home owners as of 2010 as interaction term in column (3) does not materially affect the coefficient of interest.7 | Table 6 about here | To further rule out that the recovery in house prices since the recession explains results, Figure 4 plots the 2010-16 change in county house prices against exposure; panel (a) is un- conditional, panel (b) conditional on the decline in house prices during the recession. There is an almost precise zero relationship between exposure to stress tested banks and the recovery in housing values, suggesting that employment of young firms in exposed counties does not suffer from a weaker housing recovery. The visual evidence is confirmed in column (4) of Table 6, which includes an interaction term with contemporaneous local house price growth.

However, my results speak to their findings: presence of top-four banks has a negative effect on firm formation, but the effect is due to stress tests. 3Note that an increase in risk is not inconsistent with lower loan supply due to stress tests. Stress tests discourage risky lending, so the same increase in borrower risk could translate into a stronger contraction in loan supply if banks are being stress tested. 31 Cortes, Demyanyk, Li, Loutskina and Strahan (forthcoming) define industry betas, or industry risk, as the long-run sensitivity of industry employment to changes in aggregate employment.

The positive correlation is in line with theories in which risky borrower are required to pledge collateral (Steijvers and Voordeckers, 2009; Berger, Espinosa- Vega, Frame and Miller, 2011). 26 entrepreneurship due to stress tests contributes to the slowdown in post-crisis growth. Table 8 shows that counties with higher exposure to stress tested banks see a fall in patent applications of young firms. Each column uses log patents by young firms as dependent variable at the county-IPC-year level.* Column (1) includes year fixed effects and shows that patent applications by young firms decline significantly for counties with higher exposure. Adding county controls in column (2) and time-varying fixed effects at the state and industry (IPC) level in column (3) does not materially affect size or significance of the coefficient. Across specifications, there is a significant negative effect of exposure on patent applications by young firms. | Table 8 about here | Not all patents are used: if other companies do not use the underlying innovation (due to\ndummy patents or patent trolling), the decline in patents by young firms has no consequences. To account for incremental innovations, column (4) shows that the effect of exposure on patents is stronger when I weight patents by citations, i.e. account for how often they are used. Com- pared to column (3), effect size almost doubles in magnitude, suggesting that counties that generated highly-cited patents are particularly affected. This finding holds in column (5) that instruments observed with predicted exposure and reports a significant negative coefficient. In terms of magnitude, moving a county from the 25 to the 75\" percentile in terms of expo- sure leads to a relative decline in citation-weighted patents by 16.2%. Finally, columns (6)-(7) replicate columns (4)-(5), but use log (weighted) patents by old firms as dependent variable. There is an insignificant and weakly positive effect of exposure on patents by old firms. In conclusion, Table 8 suggest that counties with higher exposure to stress tested banks see a decline in innovation by young firms, but no significant increase in patents of old firms. The decline in loan supply to young firms hence reduces their capability to innovate. Following the financial crisis, the U.S. witnessed an unprecedented decline in growth.

Bank and county level results show that the contraction in lending is strongest for secured loans, and that the decline in young firm employment particularly strong in home-equity intensive industries. Columns (2)-(3) show that the same hold for labor productivity: the decline in average wages is concentrated in industries that rely more on home equity financing. This result holds without and with county*time and industry*time fixed effects that control for local and industry demand in columns (2) and (3), as well as when I instrument exposure with predicted exposure in columns (4)-(5).

Discussion An emerging literature examines how the drop in firm formation during the Great Recession affects productivity (Bassetto, Cagetti and De Nardi, 2015; Siemer, 2016).

{"text": "contributes to the productivity slowdown above and beyond the immediate effects of the crisis. However, my results have to be viewed with caution. First, stress tests have the intention of increasing the resilience of the financial sector against shocks. They achieve this by increasing capital requirements during a transition period. Once the economy reaches its new steady state and banks adjust their portfolios accordingly, higher capital requirements need no longer have negative effects on entrepreneurship or growth. Second, a sounder financial system could reduce macroeconomic volatility and the probability of a future crisis. A lower probability of future negative shocks might be worth slower growth during calm periods, and could translate into higher growth on average. This debate dates back to work on the trade-off between financial 3For literature on the effects of loan supply on productivity, see Duval, Hong and Timmer (2017); Manaresi and Pierri (2017); Doerr, Raissi and Weber (2018); for work showing how changes in the allocation of credit across borrower classes affect aggregate growth, see Acharya, Eisert, Eufinger and Hirsch (2017); Schivardi, Sette and Tabellini (2017); Blattner, Rebelo and Farinha (2018). 28 stability and growth, a theme well-explored for developing countries (Loayza, Ranciere, Serven and Ventura, 2007; Loayza, Ouazad and Ranciere, 2017). With respect to productivity, my reduced form regressions attribute the overall effect of exposure on labor productivity exclusively to the decline in young firms. While a large literature highlights the importance of young firms for growth and productivity estimates in Table 9 are qualitatively in line with those for employment in Table 4, the nature of my data does prohibits to exactly estimate the magnitude of the effect of exposure on productivity. Local labor productivity is affected by the activity of young firms, but also reflects actions by, for example, older and large firms. Since stress tests potentially affect banks and the economy beyond credit supply to young firms, they could affect productivity through channels besides start-up financing in general equilibrium. For example, lower firm entry can reduce incumbents incentives to innovate and exacerbate the initial effect (Aghion, 2017). 5 Conclusion This paper provides new evidence that post-crisis financial regulation has stymied entrepreneur- ship. I show that stress tested banks strongly cut small business lending secured by collateral and that the contraction in loan supply had real effects. Exploiting geographic variation in county exposure to stress tested banks, I find that counties with a higher exposure have seen a relative decline in employment at young firms during the recovery. In line with the literature that highlights the sensitivity of young firms to changes in collateral values, I find that the con- traction in secured lending has hit entrepreneurs disproportionately harder in industries that rely more on home equity financing. Granular county-industry data ensure that my results are not confounded by unobservable shocks to local demand or industries. Results are also robust to an instrumental variable approach that predicts county exposure with a gravity model of bank expansion. Young firms have an outsized effect on aggregate innovation and growth. Consequently, I show that higher county exposure to stress tested banks reduces patent applications by young firms. lhe decline is more pronounced when I adjust for the quality of innovation and weight patents by citations. I also provide suggestive evidence that wages grow more slowly during the recovery in exposed counties. Capital regulation in general, and stress tests in particular, are intended to reduce risk- taking. My findings suggest that post-crisis financial regulation has lead to a reallocation of credit away from risky borrowers: entrepreneurs have seen a fall in credit supply. The shift in bank credit across borrowers has had unintended side effects, having reducer dynamism and innovation during the recovery from the Great Recession. These effects should be taken into account when evaluating the overall consequences for the economy of financial regulation or 29 higher capital requirements, especially in light of the current debate on declining dynamism and the post-crisis productivity slowdown. Yet, my results do not imply that stress testing is bad for welfare. Reducing volatility and the incidence of crises might require a reduction in risky lending to young firms. This paper highlights a possible trade-off between financial stability and growth, but does not take a stance on the efficiency or long-run implications of the implemented policy. 30 References\nAcharya, Viral V., Allen N.", "tokens": 722, "label": "heavy"}

Entrepreneurs are 1m- cost of (secured) small small and use col- portant for innovation business lending lateral to receive and productivity financing => Stress tested banks re- => Decline in young firms duce (secured) small = Decline in loan supply reduces innovation business lending by stress tested banks and productivity (Section 3.1, Table 2) hurts young firms (Sec. 3.2, Tables 8+9) (Section 3.2, Table 4) Note: This table summarizes the steps of the empirical argument. Since stress tests make (secured) small business lending expensive for banks (in terms of capital requirements), I show that (a) stress tested banks reduce their credit supply to small firms, especially if firms use real estate collateral. Entrepreneurs are mostly small and opaque, so they rely on real estate collateral and home equity to start or expand their business. Consequently, (b) in counties where stress tested banks are more important, entrepreneurs are hit harder by the reduction in credit supply, and the more so in home equity intensive industries; and (c) entrepreneurs have an outsized importance for innovation and aggregate growth, so the decline in young firms due to the contraction in loan supply hurts innovation and productivity in counties with higher exposure to stress tested banks. Identifying business-related loans in HMDA data My main data source for loan level data is the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Ultimate Loan Application Register (LAR). To construct the HMDA baseline sample, I follow what is standard in the literature: e restrict the sample to originated, approved, or purchased loans e restrict the sample to conventional or FHA insured loans e exclude multifamily properties e drop loans with no information on the borrower county fips code e drop loans with missing borrower county fips code", "tokens": 320, "label": "medium"}

These conditions reduce the number of bank-borrower observations (loans) on average by around one-third in a given year.

Business loans with personal guarantees would come under this rule. On average, around 3.5% of yearly bank-borrower observations (loans) represent business-related home equity loans. For example, in 2008 there were 560,000 business-related loans that were financed with home equity. I then aggregate to the bank-county level.

{"text": "I keep patent applications by U.S. and foreign companies or corporations, as well as individuals. I drop patent applications by universities and governments, and aggregate patent data at the inventors county. If there are more than one inventor from the same county, the patent is counted once for the respective county. If there are more than one inventor in different counties, the patent is counted equally in each county (I split the patent on a pro-rata basis per inventor). Finally, I define patents by young firms as patent application by assignees (i.e. corporations) that did not file a patent application more than five years ago. For example, suppose Sebastian Inc. files its first ever patent application in 2005. All patents filed until 2010 are then classified as patents by young firms, all patents from 2011 onward as old. Patents are often used as a proxy for innovative activity. However, they have two important drawbacks. First, not all firms patent their ideas, and if and how they do so can vary across industries and areas. Yet, the correlation between R&D and the number of patents in the cross-section of firms is usually high (Griliches, 1990). Second, patents can contain a different amount of ideas. Aggregating to the county level mitigates this problem, because differences in the amount of ideas across patents average out in the aggregate and level effects can be addressed via fixed effects (Peri, 2005; Matray, 2015). o0 Table 11: Variable definitions: bank level Variable business-related home equity amount secured small business loans unsecured SB loans share secured SB loans log(assets) return on assets deposits to assets", "tokens": 268, "label": "medium"}

We have a joint website - www.endorganpillaging.org - which posts our work as we do it. David Kilgour also has a website - www.david-kilgour.com - which keeps up to date on this issue, also posting the work of all three of us.

Recapitulation Bloody Harvest came out in three versions, first in July 2006, second in January 2007 and third, in book form, in August 2009. The first report was prompted by a request David Kilgour and David Matas received from an NGO to investigate a statement that a woman (given the pseudonym \"Annie\") had made.", "tokens": 70, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Annie told the newspaper the Epoch Times in a story published in its March 17, 2006 issue: \"One of my family members was involved in the operation to harvest Falun Gong practitioners organs.\" The requesting NGO was the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong. (This NGO is similar in name to the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong, but is a different organization.) Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, began in May 1992 with the teachings of Li Hongzhi. The two Davids have described Falun Gong as a set of exercises with a spiritual and ethical foundation. Ethan Gutmann in The Slaughter States: \"Falun Gong, simply put, is a Buddhist revival movement.\" In 1999 the Communist Party of China decided to repress the spiritual practice and its practitioners. Those who did the exercises after the repression campaign was launched were arrested and asked to denounce the practice.", "tokens": 153, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Those who did so were released. Those who did not were tortured. Those who still refused to recant after torture disappeared into the Chinese gulag - China's network of labour camps, detention centres, psychiatric hospitals, prisons, and black jails, sometimes referred to as the \"Laogai System.\"\nChapter one of the book Bloody Harvest set out the methods David Kilgour and David Matas used to do their research. Amongst the methodological principles used were an insistence on looking at all evidence and a refusal to jump to conclusions based on only some of the evidence; a refusal to rely on hearsay or rumour or third party evidence; and an insistence that any evidence which the two Davids saw independent researchers could see on their own to form their own conclusions. Chapter two set out contextual information, the general repression of Falun Gong. Whatever one concludes about the killing of Falun Gong for their organs, the vilification and brutalization of practitioners of Falun Gong in China is incontestable. Chapters three and four provided some Falun Gong witness/victim statements. These statements showed, in chapter three, that many detained Falun Gong practitioners refused to identify themselves to the authorities. The non-self-identified were more numerous than the self-identified and with rare exceptions, were never released. These statements also showed, in chapter four, that Falun Gong practitioners in detention were systematically blood tested and organ examined. Non-Falun Gong detainees did not experience similar tests and examinations. Chapter five set out statements of patients who went to China for transplants. These statements showed that organs were available on short notice, in secrecy, with a heavy involvement of military personnel and institutions. Chapter six looked at Chinese transplant hospitals. Many of these hospitals on their websites actively promoted transplant tourism, advertising easy, quick availability of organs, at high prices. Chapter seven detailed calls investigators made to hospitals. The callers pretended to be relatives of patients who needed transplants and asked for organs of practitioners of Falun Gong. The reason for the requests was that the exercises of practitioners meant the organs would be healthy. Hospitals throughout China told the callers, in calls which were taped, transcribed and translated, that they had organs of Falun Gong practitioners for sale. Chapter eight attempted to estimate the sourcing of organs based on Chinese government statements of transplant volumes. The estimate was that, from 2000 to 2005, at a transplant volume of the official figure of ten thousand a year, approximately 41,500 organs during those six years came from practitioners of Falun Gong. Chapter nine looked at Sujiatun hospital, where Annie's husband worked. Some investigators went to the hospital several weeks after Annie's statement and found nothing. The chapter pointed out that this sort of investigation had little probative value. Chapter ten set out work from other researchers on the subject. All the researchers corroborated the results of the two Davids. Chapter eleven provided the responses of the Government of China to the evidence of the killing of practitioners of Falun Gong for their organs. The responses have been harassment, bullying, spying, disinformation, and anti-Falun Gong propaganda. Chapter twelve went through foreign laws on transplant tourism and Chinese laws on transplant abuse. The conclusion was that the laws which should have been in place to prevent the killing of Falun Gong for their organs and selling the organs to transplant tourists were not in place. Chapter thirteen examined ethical codes of conduct of transplant professionals on transplant tourism and relationships with Chinese transplant professionals. The chapter noted that there had been substantial development in these codes since the first report of the two Davids, but that there was still much to do. Chapter fourteen asked the question \"How does one best combat human rights violations in China?\" The answer given was to go after the worst violations first - in this instance, the killing of Falun Gong practitioners for their organs. Chapter fifteen addressed the Chinese Communist Party claim that human rights values are Western. The argument of the chapter is that human rights values are universal. Chapter sixteen addresses the question \"How do we end organ transplant abuse in China? The chapter made a number of recommendations, one of which is the need for an institutionally-based independent investigation into organ transplant abuse in China.", "tokens": 713, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "Ethan Gutmann devised a test to either confirm or reject the basic conclusions of Bloody Harvest: instead of relying on Chinese official transplant numbers, investigative phone calls, and other evidence that had previously come to light, the investigation would start with a blank page and attempt to fill the space with field research and witnesses who had never been spoken to. This created an environment where the goals of the investigation could be hidden from the subjects as well. Gutmann and his researchers Leeshai Lemish and Jaya Gibson ended up travelling across four continents, interviewing well over one hundred individuals over a six-year period. After his first ten interviews with Falun Gong refugees, Gutmann began to suspect that the conclusions of Bloody Harvest were true, and possibly even understated. However, Gutmann also wondered if evidence that only focused on the central question - \"Are the allegations true?\" - would fully persuade critical readers in the West. For example, it is simple common sense that murder requires a motive. Yet China is a complex culture; establishing a motive cannot always be reduced to a soundbite. Instead, Gutmann decided that, given a comprehensive history of the conflict between the Chinese Communist Party and Falun Gong, the readers themselves would be capable of answering certain basic questions: \"Why did the Party attack Falun Gong? How did a relatively routine Party crackdown degenerate into mass murder?\" Critical readers might also want to understand how forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience began. Soa new line of investigation was created focusing on the following questions: \"Was Falun Gong the first victim group to be harvested? If not, how did the organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience begin?", "tokens": 282, "label": "medium"}

{"text": "In August 2014, Prometheus Books published The Slaughter: Mass Killings Organ Harvesting, and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem. Chapter one established that the first known cases of live organ harvesting - in essence, a surgeon extracting the organs from a living human being so that the surgeon becomes the executioner - were performed in 1995 on the execution grounds of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in Northwest China. For example, a Uyghur surgeon, Enver Tohti, recounted extracting the kidneys and a liver from a prisoner who had been shot in the chest with the objective not to kill the prisoner but to send the prisoner's body into shock (and this update confirms that live organ harvesting using medical methods would actually become a routine procedure a few years later). The chapter also established that the first forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience - in this case, Uyghur Muslim activists - were administered in Urumagi, the capital of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, in 1997. Another medical witness described being forced to administer blood tests of Uyghur political prisoners on behalf of a handful of aging, high-ranking, Chinese Communist Party officials who needed tissue-matched organs.", "tokens": 195, "label": "medium"}

Yet there was no guarantee in 1997 that organ harvesting would become the Party's preferred method of eliminating prisoners of conscience, so the research question then turns from the \"how?\" to the \"why?\"", "tokens": 120, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Chapter two is the first of six chapters that examines how the conflict between the Chinese State and Falun Gong evolved over time. Beginning in 1992, the chapter tracks various Falun Gong practitioners - a university student, a professor, a small business owner, and a female pensioner - to illustrate how the practice could spread so quickly throughout Chinese society and even into the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party. The chapter also reveals the testimony of a finance minister who is told to cooperate in the secret surveillance and repression of Falun Gong in 1996, demonstrating that the Party had already decided to eliminate Falun Gong and any remaining debate was largely over tactics. The author identifies three main factors in the Party's decision to eliminate Falun Gong: its size (at least 70 million, and therefore slightly larger than the membership of the Party), its cross-appeal (particularly in the upper echelons of the Party), and its values of truth, compassion, and forbearance (the nationalist wing of the Party believed these values harkened back to a period of Chinese weakness and thus were in conflict with China becoming globally dominant). The chapter ends in early 1999, shortly before the repression of Falun Gong became Officially stated policy. Chapter three traces the history of the Falun Gong crackdown from the spring of 1999 to the end of the year, when the repression was fully operational. The key points are that Falun Gong walked into several carefully laid-out traps as the Chinese Communist Party prepared a massive public crackdown. The author also makes the controversial case that the crackdown was not the work of one man, President Jiang Zemin, but a systematic campaign with the tacit support of the majority within the politburo. It is germane to the development of forced organ harvesting in China that both the Falun Gong resistance and the lethal use of torture by state authorities had taken shape before the end of December 1999. Chapters four, five, six, and seven follow individuals on opposite sides of the fence: an officer of the secret police, a prison camp director, and a series of Falun Gong practitioners demonstrating, printing leaflets, and hijacking television signals. The narrative of pursuit, arrest, torture, and, in several cases, execution, illustrates that Falun Gong was putting up an increasingly effective resistance - even as the state's structure of persecution was spinning out of control, and shedding any remaining inhibitions surrounding the mass exploitation of Falun Gong for their organs. The \"self-immolation\" of Falun Gong practitioners on Tiananmen Square is also examined in detail, with the conclusion that it was not only a set-up but a masterstroke of state propaganda. Chapter eight takes a ground-up approach to forced organ harvesting, focusing on Falun Gong practitioners who were given suspicious \"retail organs only\" physical examinations while they were in the Laogai System. What emerges is a picture of an organ harvesting regime that began giving discreet physical examinations of select Falun Gong practitioners in late 2000/early 2001, expanding into mass examinations (including Tibetan prisoners of conscience and the House Christian group \"Eastern Lightning\") by 2003, and an organ harvesting regime wasn't even being kept fully secret within the Laogai System by 2005. These findings are amplified by an extensive interview with an investigator (given the pseudonym \"Crystal\") from the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong, and an extended comparison with the findings of Bloody Harvest. Chapter nine employs a top-down approach to the evidence of forced organ harvesting beginning with the testimony of Dr. Ko Wen-je, a Taiwanese surgeon who was offered Falun Gong organs from a Mainland hospital in 2005. (Dr. Ko subsequently ran for mayor of Taipei and during a heated campaign attempted to distance himself from his interview; the actual email correspondence between the author and Dr. Ko confirming his testimony is available for download at ethan-gutmann.com). The evolution of Falun Gong harvesting after the Beijing Olympics is briefly explored, and there is also a detailed discussion of how organ harvesting played into the Chinese leadership crisis of 2012, specifically the revelation of how Wang Lijun (the right hand man to Communist Party leader Bo Xilai) experimented with mass organ harvesting in Liaoning Province. Chapter ten explores the relationship between the growth of the plastination industry concordant with the acceleration of forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience in Liaoning province. Some of the evidence from that chapter will be referenced in this report. Finally, an appendix estimates the number of Falun Gong killed for their organs between 2000 to 2008, based on in-depth interviews of a sample of approximately fifty refugees from the Laogai System. Because the intention was to fill in the full history of the Falun Gong persecution, the author was not actively seeking out Falun Gong practitioners who had experienced an unusual physical examination in detention. The author also rejected accounts of \"retail physical examinations\" if the subject gave too little detail, had been on hunger strike at the time, was Clearly influenced by talking points, or had experienced too much trauma. So the author's confidence was high that he had a genuinely conservative sample. However, the author's confidence in his final estimate: a range of 9000 to 120,000 Falun Gong were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008 was not as high, as the size of the range implicitly acknowledges. Nonetheless, the mid-range number that Gutmann chose as his best guess - 65,000 Falun Gong killed for their organs - has been widely accepted in the press. The reason for this has less to do with the author touting the accuracy of the figure, and more to do with a deep human need to contextualize tragedy with a specific number or benchmark.", "tokens": 959, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The need for an update We felt the need to produce an update to what we have done, for several reasons, seven in all.", "tokens": 24, "label": "light"}
{"text": "One is the need to make our own assessment of transplant volumes. In looking at the sources for organ transplants in China, we have, in the past, taken Chinese government official statements of overall transplant volumes at face value and focused on attempting to identify the sources for those asserted volumes. However, Chinese government statistics for transplant volumes are not necessarily reliable. One effort which needed to be made and which we finally have made is to determine on our own what Chinese transplant volumes are. We did that by looking at and accumulating the data from the individual hospitals where transplants occur. Some hospitals state their transplant volumes. For those who do not, we can, from their bed counts, personnel strength, potential patient groups, rate of growth, technological development, academic publications, and media reports, come to a conclusion on their transplant volumes. A second task, flowing from the first, was the need to address cover-up.", "tokens": 156, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Cover-up is a standard reaction to wrongdoing. Chinese Communist Party coverup is not a new story. But, because we are dealing new data, we consequently have to address cover up anew, attempts to hide individual hospital transplant figures. Deception in the data limits the yield of research from that data. Because of the Chinese corruption of the data with which we are working, we cannot make specific numerical conclusions with complete certainty. Accordingly, our estimates of Chinese transplant volumes are not expressed in single integers but in a numerical range. Despite the cover up and corruption of data, despite our inability to produce an exact figure, we are convinced that transplant volume is substantially higher than the official figure. The high volume led us into a third component of this update, to explore the driving factors behind these volumes. 10 Once we started looking at what is generating the volume, we had to look at the extent to which the Chinese Communist Party is in the driver's seat, the structure the regime has built around organ harvesting, and the culpability of some individual Party members. The update accordingly addresses that topic as well. Fifth, we analyze the Party's claims of recent transplant reform. The Chinese regime announces changes regularly on organ transplant sourcing, some of which are real, while some are not. Because the Party has moved since our last published works, we too have to move, to assess their claims of change and attempt to determine how real those claims are. A sixth new feature of this work is incorporation of whistleblower evidence. In the past, we have tended to avoid reproducing that evidence, even though we had it. We have to protect the identities of whistleblowers. That protection, while understandable, means that an independent researcher cannot identify and question the whistleblowers him or herself. Whistleblower evidence nonetheless deserves to be presented publicly, albeit with the identities of the whistleblowers disguised, if for no other reason than to encourage other whistleblowers to come forward. So it is presented here.", "tokens": 340, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Finally, this update addresses plastination, in addition to organ sourcing, a subject we have mostly not addressed before. In the past, we have shied away from addressing plastination, because plastination is different from our focus, organ transplantation. Nonetheless, there is compelling evidence that practitioners of Falun Gong are killed for both plastination and organ sourcing. The evidence supporting each abuse is also evidence in support of the other abuse. No one in the West has witnessed organ transplant abuse in China; yet a large number have seen plastinated bodies from China on display. Furthermore, plastinated body parts from China have been sold to medical schools and universities throughout the Western world. Plastination gives an immediate, widespread, publicly visible reality to the abuse that the killing of innocents for their organs cannot. A Note on Methods Used\nWe have had the benefit of work by a group of Chinese-language researchers to whom we express our profound appreciation. The researchers reviewed data from telephone surveys, hospital websites, and medical journals for the 865 hospitals in China which perform organ transplants (about 13% of all hospitals); tracked 712 liver and kidney transplant centres and collected and analyzed information about them from media reports, public and government websites, current and archived hospital websites, and medical journals; * examined individually 165 hospitals approved by the Government of China to conduct transplantation and set down their features, qualifications, revenue, potential patient groups, bed counts, personnel, transplant capacity and volume, research projects, relationships with other hospitals and parties, funding, patents, and awards; e made phone calls to a number of the hospitals to verify their current organ transplant status and to cross check information about the hospitals the searchers had previously obtained; and summarized the policies and regulations of the Government on organ transplants, reviewed the history of the industry in China, and provided information on the state military and civilian institutions which enable the industrialization 11 INTRODUCTION This update has to be read forward but understood backwards. The ultimate conclusion is that the Chinese Communist Party has engaged the State in the mass killings of innocents, primarily practitioners of the spiritually-based set of exercises, Falun Gong, but also Uyghurs, Tibetans, and select House Christians, in order to obtain organs for transplants. Even with the volumes of transplants the Chinese government has asserted in the past, there is a substantial discrepancy between the number of transplants and the number of sources which the Government of China has identified - prisoners sentenced to death and voluntary donors. This discrepancy is one reason, among several, that had led us in the past to the conclusion that the above groups have been the source of many, and indeed most, organs for transplants. The fact that the evidence we have now examined shows much larger volumes of transplants than the Government of China has asserted points to a larger discrepancy between transplant volumes and Government of China-identified sources than we had previously thought existed. That increased discrepancy leads us to conclude that there has been a far larger slaughter of practitioners of Falun Gong for their organs than we had originally estimated.", "tokens": 521, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The update begins, in chapter two, by introducing the examination of individual hospitals. It addresses the volume of evidence, the feature of the evidence and the numbers and classifications of transplant centres. Chapter three focuses on national approved military transplant centres. Chapter four considers national approved civilian transplant centres. In chapter five, we turn our attention to regional approved transplant centres. Chapter six concludes this examination of individual hospitals by looking at non-approved transplant hospitals and cornea transplant centres. Chapter seven looks at indicators of total volumes of transplants in China besides the figures which come from looking at particular hospitals. These other indicators and the examination of individual hospitals tell us that the total volume of transplants in China is a substantial multiple of the official figures. Chapter eight canvasses the various forms that cover up of transplant data takes and considers how that impacts on our own analysis. We address deletion of data, falsification of figures, underreporting and restriction of access to data as well as various pretenses used.", "tokens": 171, "label": "medium"}

In this chapter, we focus on the evidence of the fact of a crime, without attribution to a particular set of criminals. 12 In chapter twelve, we address finally who is committing this crime -the Chinese Communist Party - and why.

We are not in a position to come up with a specific figure of prisoners of conscience who have been murdered through organ harvesting. Nor can we determine how many organs are extracted, on average, from each transplant source, although the evidence suggests that we are dealing with only one organ extracted from each donor source in many cases. China did not have any form of national organ distribution until 2013. The organ distribution system in place since 2013 is, according to Chinese officials, limited to organs donated voluntarily.

{"text": "And we can say that the end of this crime against humanity is not yet in sight. 13 Chapter Two: Individual Hospitals and Doctors lI. VOLUME OF EVIDENCE The primary focus of this update is transplant volumes. Before getting into that, we need to address the volume of evidence about the killing of prisoners of conscience, primarily Falun Gong, for their organs. Many claims of human rights abuses suffer from having too little evidence. With this claim of transplant abuse in China, the volume problem is the opposite - too much evidence. There are now three books on the issue, our two and State Organs, a collection of essays which David Matas edited with Torsten Trey, published in 2012. There is an NGO dedicated to combating the abuse - Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH). There is a website focused on the issue alone - endorganpillaging.org. There have been five documentaries produced on the violation - Transmission 6-10, Free China, Red Reign, Human Harvest, and Hard to Believe. About the killing of Falun Gong for their organs, there is more than just a collection of evidence; there is a field of knowledge. In a world of thirty-second soundbites and 140-character messages, the volume of evidence is a problem. The gravity of the abuse would be a lot easier to communicate if less information were needed to show that it is happening. The number of people who have the patience to wade through all the information available on the killing of Falun Gong for their organs to come to their own conclusion is, unfortunately, comparatively small. One reason that the abuse has not received the global attention it deserves is the sheer volume of evidence that needs to be marshalled to show that the abuse exists. If we had one smoking gun or, as David Kilgour has put it, one smoking scalpel, which we could brandish to show that the abuse exists, our efforts to combat the abuse would be comparatively easy. When we have volumes of evidence that have to be considered as a whole to conclude that the abuse exists, then our audience for the abuse is regrettably but also necessarily diminished. It may seem counterintuitive in this context to add to this problem by presenting for consideration yet more evidence.", "tokens": 382, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "What this update addresses is not more of the same - more data in fields already explored. Rather, it explores a whole new data field - the data from individual hospitals. We had in the past looked at particular hospitals to point out that their websites were promoting transplant tourism. Here, we look to them for transplant volumes. Reliable transplant volume aggregates in China do not exist. The Chinese health system runs four transplant registries, one each for liver, kidney, heart and lung. Public access to the aggregate data for these four registries, which does not now exist, would be useful, if for no other reason than to cross check the proliferation of contradictory statements Chinese officials make about transplant volumes. Yet, any registry is only as reliable as the reports it receives. These registries accumulate their data from reporting hospitals. We cannot assume that every hospital reports all of its transplants to these four registries. Considering transplant volumes, hospital by hospital, doctor by doctor is, in China, a mammoth task. There are almost nine hundred hospitals and between nine and ten thousand medical personnel engaged in transplants. Moreover, cover up is not just in China an aggregate, national phenomenon. It exists as well at the doctor and 14\nhospital level. Nonetheless, to get a grip on transplant volume figures, it is a task which must be undertaken and we do so in this update. We do this not just to attempt to make more convincing the point we have made before. If you have gone through everything we have written up to now and are not already convinced that innocents in China are being killed for their organs, more data will not convince you. We make the additional effort to make an additional point - that the number of innocents killed for their organs in China is far larger than we had contemplated. The numbers stagger the imagination.", "tokens": 319, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Il. FEATURES When we look at hospitals and doctors one by one, a number of features jump out. One is the sheer volume of transplants. The total number of transplants which officials ascribe to the country as a whole, ten thousand a year, is easily surpassed by just a few hospitals. Whatever the total number is, it must be substantially more, by a multiple, than the official figure. Second, many of the hospitals are relatively new or have new transplant wings or beds. This development would not have occurred without confidence in a continuing supply of organs for transplants. The transplant business in China has developed with not only an abundance of available organs from 2001 on, but also with a confidence that this abundance would continue into the indefinite future. Third, concomitant with the large number of transplants, there is a large number of qualified staff. The transplant industry in China employs a lot of people. The investment in people as well as buildings is another testimonial to the ready availability of high volumes of organs available for transplants, not only in the immediate past and present, but also, in the view of those who have committed their careers and the careers of others to this profession, into the indefinite future. Fourth, the transplant professionals in China are engaged in substantial training and research. Research and training in transplants cannot be done without transplants. The high volume of research bespeaks itself a high volume of transplants and a ready availability of organs for transplants. Fifth, the combination of a large professional corps, a substantial building stock and significant research speaks money. Transplantation in China means money, lots of it. 15\nIl. NUMBERS & CLASSIFICATIONS OF ORGAN TRANSPLANT CENTERS According to statistics from the Administration of Hospitals under the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) in July 2015,2 there were 20,918 hospitals in mainland China. ? Among them were 1,151 Class 3 hospitals and 4,321 Class 2 hospitals. 4 Class 3 hospitals are normally located in major cities. They are typically large-scale general or specialized hospitals with over 500 beds. Among them, 705 are Class 3 Grade A (3A) hospitals. Huang Jiefu, former Deputy Minister of Health, said in March 2006, For a hospital to pass the evaluation to become a class 3A hospital, it must have completed a fixed target of more than five organ transplants. Organ transplantation has become a resource for competition among hospitals to reach the standard and for their At present, the country has too many, not too few, hospitals carrying out kidney, liver, heart, and yn branding, other types of transplants. The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong completed a comprehensive investigation of both organ transplant hospitals and doctors and determined that 865 hospitals are involved in organ transplantation. The hospitals are to be found in 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four centrally- administered municipalities, and 217 prefecture-level cities. 7 iB os Ba vel Oe Ble OR Has Bebe 1B SE Pr Rh et PHOCSREEIT ULAE Pop AR DS DSSS cotattexaiieal seureearanad - Edited at 12:46 AM File Edit Tools Help 9 ERotRA ~ 9 Ebi Aheatmap = Ehret L~ Se ERM aA Cot Ge be HeanaY No filters applied meeps ees ~ re 3 es { > ; y Ulaanbaatar < > azakhstan ~ Pe YnaaHOaatap v rr aig r f Nt Bishkek : om Buwkek Simat y om~A\n- MaTBI U: + 2kistan TT a= Kyrgyzstan Samarkand , enistan Mongolia S forth Korea Sea of Japan Ara ~O Seoul Tajikistan~ ~, Ang =-HS abat T oat 5 z t South Korea Jap hhad Se} Osaka ~ El 2 TM Islamabad | ET 4 Gwangju, ~ Air Fy = oul ee 4s cs 3 Busan 2 { Afghanistan me % SS At e ae ae pent pene. i? oi] ~ ast China Sea Pakistan New Betning 4 Jaipur Nepal Sof ae Pa * rl Pa Ssh Lucknow eS iJ : ; 7 Ahmedabad ~~ eiraimaeen 3 \" Taiwan cat at 8 India Kolkatao] aly A ad f A (Burma) Et Mumbai Laos ; 2014 Google - Map data 2014 Basarsoj Diagram 2.1 Geographic distribution of the 865 medical institutions involved in organ transplantation We have verified and confirmed 712 hospitals which carry out liver and kidney transplants.

In April 2015, Professor Ye Qifa from Central Medical University, Executive Chairman of the China Organ Transplant Alliance, who specializes in major organ transplantation, stated to a Peoples Daily Online correspondent that, before the introduction of the Human Organ Transplant Ordinance in 2007, there were over 1,000 medical institutions in China performing organ transplants.? The Ministry of Health on May 23, 2007 announced a list of 89 transplant hospitals! approved by the Review Expert Team of the Human Organ Transplantation Skills Clinical Application Committee, authorized by the Ministry of Health, to which we refer as national level hospitals. Essentially, these were the most qualified and capable national-level organ transplant centres at the time. At the same time, it announced a second list of hospitals designated to perform organ transplants, issuing 18-month temporary permits to 75 transplant centres with weaker qualifications, to which we refer as regional level hospitals. In total, 164 hospitals were given permits to conduct organ transplants.1!! On August 8, 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (successor to the Ministry of Health) published a list of 165 hospitals approved to conduct organ transplants, !2 including Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital Human Organ Transplant Centre, which performs transplants from bodies with no cardiac 17 activity. Four more hospitals were added to the list by the beginning of 2014, bringing the number of qualified hospitals to 169.1 This report focuses on the 164 hospitals which received approval from the Ministry of Health in 2007, so that we can categorize their qualifications as either national or regional level. If we exclude the 18 heart and lung transplant centres, 146 transplant centres remain, including 78 national-level hospitals and 68 designated hospitals. Among the 566 kidney and/or liver transplant centres which did not receive approval from the Ministry of Health, 405 were based in large-scale 3A hospitals. These included 56 military and armed police organ\ntransplant centres, 349 mostly-3A civilian hospitals, and 161 medium-sized hospitals (including 55 Class 3 Grade C hospitals and 106 mostly-Class 2 hospitals). Table 2.2 Classification of 712 hospitals conducting liver/ kidney transplants: Type of Transplant Centre National-level military and civilian liver and kidney transplant centres approved by the Ministry of Health in 2007 Liver and kidney transplant centres designated by the Ministry of Health in 2007 In the next section, we set out examples of different types of transplant centres, showing their qualifications, characteristics, transplant volume and capacity, and rates of growth. These examples give us an indication of overall transplant volume. 18 Chapter Three: Approved National Military Transplant Centres National level transplant centres encompasses highly qualified and capable organ transplant centres selected from over 1,000 candidates and approved by the Ministry of Health in 2007. Among them are 23 military and armed police transplant centres and 68 civilian transplant centres. The Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) is one of the few militaries in the world that belong to a political party rather than the state. It is a tool used to sustain the Communist Partys control over China. After 2000, a large number of Peoples Liberation Army Organ Transplant Centres were named and supported by the Central Military Commission and regional military commands. In December 2008, Zhang Yanling, director of the Peoples Liberation Army General Logistics Department Health Division, told Xinhua News Agency, In 1978, there were only three hospitals in the entire Peoples Liberation Army capable of performing kidney transplants. Now, there are forty hospitals capable of liver, kidney, heart, lung and multi-organ transplants.!4 According to an investigation by the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong, the military and armed police have developed over 100 transplant institutions. 1 The 23 top-level military transplant centres among the first batch approved by the Ministry of Health in 2007 were the core units that the evidence shows were carrying out live organ transplants.

According to Li's relatives, Li was diagnosed with a liver disease in early 2007, which worsened despite treatment. The Central Military Committee ordered staff to treat his condition by whatever means necessary. Within eight days, doctors found a liver source (reportedly from a 32-year-old death row prisoner) and transported the organ to No. 301 Hospital on a 40-minute helicopter flight.2 According to medical personnel who work in operating rooms at No. 301 Hospital, organ transplants are among the most frequent, common surgeries, and that transplants are performed there almost every day.?! The hospitals former president and well-known medical expert Li Qihua was a Falun Gong practitioner.

The surgeon added that the source of the organs was a \"State secret\" and that anyone revealing the source \"could be disqualified from doing such operations.\"2? The number of transplants performed at this hospital is also a military secret. However, we can gain some insight from financial information of one of its clinical divisions, the No. 309 Hospital.

It is also worth noting that Dong Jiahong was not transferred to this hospital until 2006,2 so this report implies that the department performed more than 500 liver transplants that year; this is only the public figure. No. 301 Hospital has not only conducted a large number of organ transplants by itself, but also has played a role in resolving core technical issues in organ transplantation and supporting civilian hospitals with organ sources and technical consultants.

Before 2000, these institutions had matured in their technology in kidney and liver transplants. After 2000, the technology was applied to massive numbers of patients. Within a few years, liver and kidney transplants became routine clinical surgery; organ transplantation techniques and volume increased rapidly. These hospitals became the largest transplant centres in their areas, the country, and Asia. These national-level transplant centres popularized their clinical technology throughout the country, trained a large number of transplant doctors, and led the exponential growth of Chinas transplant industry. EXAMPLES Tianjin First Central Hospital Organ Transplant Institute (Oriental Organ Transplant Centre) Tianjin First Central Hospitals Organ Transplant Institute is the largest transplant center in Asia and ranked first in China in the cumulative volume of transplants performed for sixteen consecutive years through the end of 2013.242 59 In September 1998, the hospital established its Organ Transplant Surgery Department, which became the Tianjin Organ Transplant Centre in December 2000 and the Oriental Organ Transplant Institute in November 2003. It integrates clinical practice, teaching, and research.243 The Centre gained influence worldwide and was the first in mainland China to be included in the Clinical Transplants registry. 244 Shen Zhongyang\nShen Zhongyang is known as the founder of Chinas liver transplant field. From the time he graduated from China Medical University in 1984 until 1998, Shen twice studied in Japan. According to data from the Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation,2* after Shen returned to China in 1998, he began to build an organ transplant division and a transplant institute at Tianjin First Central Hospital, which became the Oriental Organ Transplant Centre. Since then, Shen has been the director of the centre. He became president of the hospital in 2007. In 2001, Shen set up the transplant centre at the Tianjin Armed Police General Hospital and established the Liver Transplant Institute at the Armed Police General Hospital in Beijing in April 2002. The latter quickly topped the rankings in the Beijing area for the volume and success rate of liver transplants performed.2* He also assisted in the creation of the Jinan Armed Police Organ Transplant Institute and the Qianfoshan Hospital Liver Transplant Centre in Shandong Province. Shen was a chief expert for transplant research under the 863 Project, a transplant expert in the Central Committee of the Health Core Group, and vice chairman of the Chinese Medical Association Organ Transplant Society-247 248 In mainland China, liver transplantation was still in its clinical exploration stage until the end of the last century. It is the only effective treatment for end-stage liver disease. In May 1994, Shen completed the first orthotopic liver transplant after he returned to China; by the end of the century, liver transplants were slowly becoming routine.2*? Shen Zhongyang was the first doctor in China to establish a modern transplant centre incorporating multiple disciplines, including anesthesia, transplant pharmacology, and pathology. He also implemented cooperation in treatment before, during and after surgery, as well as quality control.2\nShen pioneered and improved a variety of liver transplant surgical procedures. He developed an integrated prevention system that reduced the recurrence rate of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplants from over 80% to under 5%. This advance overcame the main obstacle to the development of liver transplantation in China. Shen also established a multidisciplinary liver transplant standard and procedure, with surgery as the central component. His books include Clinical Liver Transplantation, Modern Clinical Liver Transplantation, China Liver Transplantation, and Liver Transplantation Manual addressing the new theories and technologies he was exploring. Shen also provided training for dozens of transplant units across the country, helping liver transplantation become routine surgery. According to the 2009 edition of the Tianjin Medical Journal, between January 2004 and August 2008, Shen participated in 1,600 liver graft procurements.2! The now-standard procedure for grafting the liver from a donor lowered the time necessary for the organ to remain at body temperature to under five minutes and reduced the time for procurement operations to thirty minutes.252 His development of this procedure which, according to the journal article, suits the characteristics of China, indicates that Shen very likely participated in a large number of live organ procurement 60 operations, given that the five-minute procurement time indicates that the involuntary organ donor had not yet died when the liver was removed. In July 2006, the Oriental Organ Transplant Centre became Chinas liver transplant training centre.

The Centre also performed a large number of transplants.22 Oriental Organ Transplant Centre The fifth edition of Phoenix Weekly in 2006 published an article entitled Investigation into tens of thousands of foreigners going to China for organ transplants; China has become the worlds organ transplant centre.254 The article also stated that Oriental Organ Transplant Centre is the worlds largest transplant centre.

{"text": "A large number of South Korean patients poured in, making existing facilities insufficient. Now, the hospital has turned the fourth to seventh floors of the 12-floor building into transplant patient wards. It also borrowed the eighth floor of the Tianjin Economic Development Area International Cardiovascular Hospital as a hospitalization area for Korean patients. It has also converted the 24th and 25th floors of a nearby hotel into wards for patients waiting for transplants. Even so, we're still short of beds. The article says that 85% of its patients came from over 20 countries and regions, including South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Egypt, Europe, Israel, Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The cafe in the ward on the fourth floor became an international conference club, where patients of different ethnicities gather to exchange their treatment experiences. Using incomplete data, in the three years prior to the date of the article, over 3,000 patients from South Korea alone underwent organ transplants in mainland China. More than 1,000 people from other countries and regions underwent organ transplants in China every year. This was not the only hospital with an influx of overseas transplant patients; transplant centres all over the country were attracting and receiving foreign patients. Documented cases include the First Peoples Hospital of Zhejiang Province and the Guangdong Nanfang Hospital. The latter facility opened its doors specifically for overseas Chinese and was called the model medical department for benefiting overseas Chinese in 1995. It had received over 110,000 patients from over 91 countries and regions for hospitalization and examination. The hospital had completed 2,123 kidney transplants by as early as November 2001.2 Volume of Organ Transplants The same Phoenix Weekly article stated, According to family members of patients, the Organ Transplant Centre carries out up to 24 liver and kidney transplants in one day. The hospital once set a record of completing 44\nliver transplants within one week in December 2004. Because its 120 hospital beds were insufficient, the Oriental Organ Transplant Center rented a large number of rooms from nearby hotels and a hospital for foreign transplant patients. At the time, the facility had seven liver and kidney transplant teams. They had almost no rest days: ...doctors hurriedly shuttle between wards and operating rooms, with 61 no time to greet one another. They kept saying, These few days are crazy busy, with more than a dozen surgeries a day. Some doctors were even \"rushing surgeries all night long [and] did not sleep at all.\" Doctors complain that the off-season is only a month after the New Year; they are busy until the end of the year and normally dont go home. The end of the year is particularly busy. Because of its growth after 2000, the Center broke ground in 2002 on its new building with 500 transplant beds. The project was funded by the Tianjin municipal government, which aimed to build Asias largest integrated organ transplant center. 28 GH HEM SH Bees... & = www.ccem-em120.com/zhongxiyiguokan/cccm/pdf/2006-2/18 8 SHEER SA BS sosissarp Previous Hard Work Sees Renewed Glory Today Well-Known Transplant Specialist Professor Shen Zhongyang.

Based on developmental needs, it had added 300 beds and adjusted the number allocated for several departments, including the organ transplant center.24\nThe average hospitalization time for liver transplants at this center was 25-30 days but was later shortened to 20-23 days.2 In general, hospitalization times for kidney recipients are much shorter. Even if we count the new building as 500 beds instead of 700, when it achieved a 100% bed utilization rate (around 2010 by its growth trend), the transplant volume may have reached 6,000 to 8,000 per year. With its 131% bed utilization rate in 2013, the corresponding annual volume may have been as high as 7,800 to 10,400. It also added beds later, pushing the annual transplant volume even higher. The hospital has 17 operating rooms. If these 17 operating rooms were in use at the same time, at least 30 liver and kidney transplants could be completed in one day. Then 30 x 360 = 10,800 transplants could be done in one year. This calculation is based on only a regular utilization rate and a workload of fewer than two operations a day per transplant operating room. After evidence of live organ harvesting in China attracted international attention, the authorities deleted web pages and claimed that the number of organ transplants had decreased after 2006. It used Tianjin First Central Hospital as an example to promote this story. On December 18, 2007, Southern Weekly published the article China is calling a stop to transplant tourism, 2 which claimed that, starting from 2007, the number of transplants at the hospital suddenly dropped significantly due to lack of organ supply, that it conducted only 15 liver transplants in the first half of the year, and that the donors were all patients relatives. 63 Yet, in April 2009, the hospitals official web page said that it ranked first in the country for the number of liver and kidney transplants for the four preceding years.2 The hospital could not have performed only fifteen liver transplants in the first six months of 2007 and still rank first in the country in volume for liver transplants in 2007. The current official website shows a bed count less than the number before the new building was put into use in 2006 - only 120 transplant surgery beds and seven liver and kidney transplant teams.28 However, its archived webpages since 2003 show that the Centre, funded by the Tianjin municipal government, would include 500 transplant beds and aim for 500 liver transplants, 300 kidney transplants, and other types of transplants per year.2? This suggests that each transplant bed would accommodate only one to two patients per year, an unlikely scenario. The transplant volume of this centre can be cross-checked with those conducted by individual doctors. Based on published papers, the Centre has 110 doctors participating in liver and kidney transplants, among whom 46 are chief or associate chief physicians and 13 are attending physicians.2 Shen Zhongyangs biography shows that he had completed close to 10,000 liver transplants by the end of 2014.27! His colleagues and the majority of the doctors he had trained had each independently completed approximately 1,000 transplants.272 Thus, while the centre claims that it has completed 10,000 organ transplants in total, this figure is surpassed by just a few doctors.273 By 2011, Vice President Zhu Zhijun of Tianjin First Central Hospital had completed 1,400 liver transplants and 100 liver transplants from relatives donors. 274 Cai Jinzhen, the deputy director of the liver transplant department, had completed 1,500 liver transplants; Cai has worked in the centre since 2000 and had developed in-depth experience in liver transplantation.27 As of July 2006, associate chief surgeon Pan Cheng had independently completed over 1,000 liver transplants, over 100 liver transplants from relative donors.276", "tokens": 718, "label": "heavy"}

Over the years, the hospital has seen all-around development in kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplantation. It claims to be the most comprehensive organ transplantation centre in China, with its transplant volume growing rapidly each year.2! A report in 2004 showed that its transplant volume had been increasing at a rate of 50% a year. 282 In December 2003, it partnered with the worlds largest organ transplant institute and jointly established the Fudan University Zhongshan Hospital - University of Pittsburgh Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute Liaison Centre.283 Zhongshan Hospitals kidney transplant unit includes 27 doctors, 6 senior professionals, 5 associate chief physicians. The liver transplant unit includes 10 senior professionals and 9 associate chief surgeons and physicians. The heart surgery department has 3 senior professionals.

Since 2001, liver transplantation at this hospital has seen rapid development, with increased variety, more innovations, shorter operating times (4 to 6 hours on average), less bleeding, and fewer complications. Some patients are discharged 9 days after their operation. Transplant recipients extend from patients of liver cancer to those of hepatitis, congenital liver diseases, and other end-stage liver diseases. Its quantity and success rate of liver transplantation lead both the Shanghai region and the country.285 The Liver Surgery Department of Zhongshan Hospital serves as the Shanghai Liver Cancer Clinical Medical Centre, one of Chinas two major liver cancer research facilities. It recently started immediate outpatient follow- up treatments with its liver transplant patients, such that a patient receives their operation immediately after an exam and hospital admission, accelerating the treatment cycle. It has attracted patients from more than ten countries and regions and seen dramatic growth in surgery volume. In February 2015, the department moved into the new Shanghai Liver Cancer Medical Centre building. It now has 230 beds, with its scale and medical capabilities among the worlds best.286 The departments leading figures are Professor Fan Jia and Professor Zhou Jian. It currently has a faculty of 41 members, including 22 with senior professional titles and 16 surgeons qualified to perform liver transplants. 287 Over 90% of its staff hold doctoral degrees. The hospitals president, Fan Jia, also serves as the director of the Fudan University Organ Transplant Centre and the director of the Shanghai Liver Cancer Clinical Medical Centre. Between 1999 and 2000, Fan went to the University of Pittsburgh Starzl Transplantation Institute as a senior visiting scholar for clinical surgical research on liver transplantation and liver surgery. For the past 5 years, he has presided over 14 major research subjects at the national, provincial, and ministerial levels, including the 973 Program, 863 Program, the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, and more. He also helped create the Shanghai Standards for transplantation.2 By 2012, he had completed more than 7,000 liver cancer surgeries, including over 1,300 liver transplants.289 The Urology Department of this hospital completed its first cadaveric kidney transplant in January 1970 and was one of Chinas first to carry out an allogeneic kidney transplant. In August 1983, the department published Chinas first book on organ transplantation, entitled Kidney Transplantation. In 2000, the department made a breakthrough in kidney transplantation and continues to innovate in its clinical work. The department currently has 4 full professors and 5 associate professors, including 2 doctoral advisors and 3 masters advisors.270 The departments director, Zhu Tongyu, is currently in charge of Chinas organ transplantation clinical research programs. He successfully conducted a very challenging fourth kidney transplant and Asias first sequential heart-liver-kidney transplant.2?! Its Heart Surgery Department presides over China's heart transplantation access ordinance. In May 2000, it successfully conducted a heart transplant on the youngest recipient in China. The department has developed a complete set of standard procedures for heart transplantation. All of its heart transplant patients achieve ambulation within 3 days. It claims to account for approximately half of all heart transplants in China. It also innovated in the field of heart preservation technology and seta record for safely preserving a heart for 7 hours. 292 66\nThe Thoracic Surgery Department stated on its website that lung transplantation is so far the only effective treatment for end-stage lung diseases. The department has accumulated abundant experience in lung transplantation with significant achievements.

He established the Centre's organ transplant division in 1992 331 and developed kidney, liver, combined liver-kidney, and combined pancreas-kidney transplants. The web page indicates that the Centre has become one of the largest comprehensive organ transplant centres in China and is the largest multi-organ transplant centre in northeastern China. Liu trained over twenty doctoral students and over thirty masters students. He also guided many units to develop kidney transplant surgeries. The posting indicates that he had been promoted to vice president of the First Hospital of China Medical University for his achievements. According to its archived web pages,??2 the Centre in 2004 had two professors, two associate professors, four doctorates, seven doctoral students, and two masters students. In total, it had sixteen people with graduate degrees, with over half of them having studied or received training overseas.

Patients from Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, and that patients from other places flock there because of its reputation. 337 By December 2006, Chen had participated in at least 632 kidney transplants.338 On May 25, 2012, when an investigator of the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong called Chen, he stated that he had participated in Wang Lijuns human experiments, and so did China Medical University and its affiliated hospitals.339 This is a partial transcript, translated, of the conversation between them: Investigator: Wang Lijun had a post-drug-injection transplantation project. Have you collaborated with him on this? Chen R.S.: Not only us, China Medical University, and its affiliated hospitals, were also involved in this. Investigator: Some of the organs were from detained Falun Gong practitioners. Can you confirm this? Chen R.S.: Those were all handled through the courts. Director Liu Yongfeng of China Medical Universitys Organ Transplant Institute stated that he participated in the research and development of organ preservation solutions and developed kidney preservation solutions that led the field in China. His account further stated that his technique of multiple abdominal organ procurement reduced damage to organs and has become the most widely used procurement technique in China.

The fourth day after I arrived at Renji Hospital, I performed the first liver transplant. The next week, we successfully completed 4 liver transplants.

The shortest hospitalization times for liver transplants are listed at or below two weeks, including 9 days at Fudan University>? and 12 days at Shandong Provincial Hospital Organ Transplant Center. 354 Even assuming a 30-day hospitalization time and a 100% utilization rate, 90 beds would allow 1,080 transplants per year, and 110 beds would allow 1,320 transplants per year. If Renji Hospital had also achieved a three-week hospitalization time and if we deduct a small number of beds used for other purposes, its annual liver transplant quantity would have reached over 1,500. Renji was one of the first hospitals in Shanghai to conduct kidney transplants.355 Its urology department established a new wing and renal transplant ward in Pudong in November 1999 and later expanded to 70 beds. Its new medical team and distribution system allowed its number of surgeries to increase by 300%.356 The medium- sized department performs over 5,000 surgeries per year, with over 60% being large and extra-large operations. The average hospitalization time is five days.357 These data points suggest that the hospital performs as many kidney transplants as liver transplants. 79 Obtaining Organs Directly from Military Sources Xia Qiang said, If there is a sufficient supply of livers, we will not start liver transplants from living donors [referring to patients relatives], since, after all, it requires healthy donors to bear the risk of surgery. 358 According to a Wenhui Daily report, among the 1,500 surgeries completed at the hospital between 2004 and 2013, just over 300 were from living relative donors. The hospitals realistic capacity is over 1,000 transplants per year and the number of relative donors (33 per year on average) represent a fraction of its total volume. A page on Good Doctors Online, a widely used medical directory for Chinese doctors, states, In 2013, with the strong support of hospital officials, it [the hospital] set up the first Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) in Shanghai. By June 2014, it has already obtained 22 organ donations, including from 14 adults and 8 children, providing 17 livers and 34 kidneys, accounting for two-thirds of all organ donations in the Shanghai area.29 If we consider only the officially published volume of transplants, the sources of more than 1,100 transplants among the 1,500 are unexplained.

According to Zhu Jiye, director of the Peking University Peoples Hospitals organ transplant centre, the Peoples Hospital had performed 4,000 kidney transplants that year.

Based on a version saved on transplantation.org.cn on January 9, 2014, the hospital claimed to have conducted 18 liver transplants between April 2005 and February 2014, and 21 liver transplants to date.120 However, we found a liver transplant study published by one of its doctors, for which the patient sample size was six times the number of transplants that the hospital had claimed. These samples were only a small portion of a large number of transplants that met the study criteria. Therefore, the hospital's\nactual number of liver transplants is most likely well above the figure of six times the official number. For example, Mo Yiwo, current director of the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, published a study that he conducted on eight piggyback orthotopic liver transplants between August 2000 and July 2002 (23 months).12! Another doctor from the hospital published a paper about lung infections in 55 orthotopic liver transplant patients between April 2005 and May 2007. 1292 Zeng Zhong, deputy director of the transplantation centre, published a paper about biliary reconstruction of 55 orthotopic liver transplant patients between April 2005 and March 2007. 1293 Another paper randomly selected 12 orthotopic liver transplant patients who 235 236 underwent the surgery at the hospital between 2007 and 2009,1204 The team performed liver transplants for three patients simultaneously on June 24, 2005. Its total number of liver transplants performed puts it at a leading position in Yunnan Province.!25 Chen Minggqing, the president of the hospital who passed away in 2012, studied liver transplantation at the University of Colorado Hospital Transplant Centre in the U.S. and the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong.1!2% The kidney transplant team performed its first kidney allograft in 1983. Professor Ma Chaolong has 29 years of clinical experience in urologic surgery and kidney transplantation. He studied kidney transplantation at the University of Colorado in the U.S. between March 1998 and June 1999,1207 The online profile of the hospitals transplantation department states that it has conducted 41 kidney transplants since 1983, including 17 with living relative donors.128 However, doctors at the hospital published a study in 2008 based on 50 living relative-donor kidney transplants between February 2002 and May 2008.1209\nBased on this number, in the six-year period between 2002 and 2008, the number of living relative-donor kidney transplants is three times the hospitals total claim for the 33-year period. Another study was based on a sample of 18 out of 84 kidney transplants. 121 From these fragments, one can see that its publically advertised transplant volume has been severely deflated. The hospitals cardiothoracic surgery department is the only qualified lung transplant unit in Yunnan Province. It conducted the first allogenic lung transplant in the province in 2005 and won a provincial science and technology progress award.

According to He Xiaoshun, the number in 2000 was 10 times higher; by 2005, the annual number had tripled to 5,192. However, this was just the beginning of the rapid growth, when liver and kidney transplants became a routine operation throughout the country. On May 11, 2011, Wu Mengchao, president of the Affiliated Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital of the Second Military Medical University and father of hepatobiliary surgery in China,!282 claimed in an interview with Sina that, in terms of liver transplants, our quantity has been the largest in the world. The quality and result are also good. We have caught up with international standards. 1383 About 6,000 liver transplants are performed in the U.S. each year.1384 As set out elsewhere in this report, Tianjins Oriental Organ Transplant Centers annual volume alone surpassed the annual number of liver transplants in the U.S. In January 2015, Huang Jiefu told CCTV, \"I would like to quote the words of the World Health Organization that China has undertaken such a path in six to seven years whereas other developed countries building up their organ donation and transplant framework took dozens of years.\"1385 2. MEDIA REPORTS In the previous chapters we cited a number of Chinese media reports as sources of evidence about transplant volumes in individual hospitals. These media reports are significant beyond the information contained in them.", "tokens": 381, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Outside China, in countries with a free media, information in the media is not much different from information found elsewhere. What is relevant is the information which is contained in the media. 264 In China, it is not like that, because everything in the media escapes either censorship or self censorship. A media story in China is not just the information contained in it. It is also a statement that the Party wants this published, or has allowed it to be published or that the author and medium both think that the Party would not mind its being published. What is true of the media is also, in one sense, true of hospital websites and research publications. Nothing gets posted or published without the approval or implied consent of the Party. Nonetheless, the media are subject to especial Party scrutiny. The Government of China General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) focusses specifically on the print news media and books. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) focuses on radio, TV, film and internet broadcasts. When something comes out in the media, the fact that it has survived this scrutiny means something. The media stories about organ transplant volumes are a bit like the phone call admissions. The medium which reports the story, like the person being called, is oblivious to what in fact is being admitted. The media stories are snippets of information about high transplant volumes. They are, in effect, mindless admissions or concessions by the Party/State that the volume of transplants is a lot higher than the official Party line of 10,000 a year. We reproduce below some of these media stories. Sina In November 2011, Sina Global News reported that Wuhan, a major city in central China, is said to be Chinas largest organ transplant centre. Among its hospitals, Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science & Technology is the most well-known; its also one of Chinas first and most authoritative hospitals for living kidney transplants. It conducts thousands of kidney transplants each year and has Chinas largest pool of kidney recipients. 1386 Asia Times 7 Fj Asia Times Online :: Chins x _ < C [5 www.atimes.com/atimes/China/HDO4Ad01.htm! tric tiaamct, iwi my ulm vaya!

This hospital would focus on organ transplants. A Taiwanese businessman told the media that a Class 3 hospital in Zhangzhou, a city neighboring Xiamen, in Fujian Province, conducted at least 3,000 kidney transplants annually. 139 At least a quarter of the kidney recipients were from Taiwan. Calculating by the market price of $1 to 2 million NTD (New Taiwan Dollar) per kidney transplant, Changgeng Hospital would have a promising future by focusing on organ transplants.

HOSPITAL REPORTS ON VOLUME Over the past decade, the Chinese authorities have not released the annual volume of each hospital and only claimed that 10,000 to 20,000 organ transplants are performed each year. In addition, it has actively removed data previously published on individual hospital websites. However, even from the data scattered on the websites, it is obvious that this number would be easily surpassed by just a few hospitals and individuals. One should keep in mind that many of these published figures are likely deflated, as hospitals attempt to cover up the true volume of transplants being performed (see section IV: Cover-Up). Case Study: An Unlikely Surgeon at a Prolific Research Institute Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command has the earliest Military Nephrology Research Institute that is often seen as the Mayo Clinic of China. It was prioritized by the Central Military Commission!3% and was the first transplant center in China.139\nLi Leishi, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and an internist by training, became the director of the hospitals transplant center. In 2008, when he was 82 years old and had cancer surgery, he said, In the past, I myself used to do 120 kidney transplants per year. Now I only do 70 cases. 1394 Li also said, Because we are a research institute, we dont do too many surgeries. 1395 This statement appears to be accurate, at least in comparison to the other 40+ military transplant centers that concentrate more on operations. Yet, during an Interview with Academician Li Leishi on China Military Online,!3 Li told a story of disciplining three doctors after a medical accident in 2001. One of them was a chief surgeon, and they had been performing hundreds of kidney transplants a year. 1397 The institution had close to 30 specialists before 2001. Eleven chief surgeons and six associate chief surgeons carried out kidney transplants.!398 If the three doctors Li mentioned had been performing hundreds of kidney transplants a year, then the seventeen chief and associate chief surgeons would collectively have conducted well over thousands each year. In that case, how many transplants has the hospital performed in the past 15+ years? Li Leishi was not the oldest of China's active transplant doctors. Academician Wu Mengchao, Chinas Father of Hepatobiliary Surgery and president of the Eastern Hepatobiliary Hospital affiliated with the Second Military Medical University, averaged 200 surgeries per year even at age 89. As of 2010, Wu had presided over 14,000 liver surgeries, including 9,300 hepatectomies,!39? the remaining 4,000+ surgeries remain unidentified and are likely to be liver transplants. Case Study: A More Operation-Oriented Hospital The Peoples Liberation Army Organ Transplant Center at No. 309 Hospital once completed 12 kidney transplants overnight.!499 We list several well-known transplant doctors: 268\nShi Bingyihad completed at least 2,130 kidney transplants, 380 liver transplants, and many heart, lung, pancreas, small intestine, and multi-organ transplants by 2011.141 Director Qian Yeyong of the transplant surgery department had also performed over 2,000 kidney transplants and many multi-organ transplants by 2013.140 Cai Ming has completed about 1,000 kidney transplants, 100 liver transplants, and several hundred organ procurement surgeries. !4 This transplant center has 231 medical and research personnel. It had 316 beds in 2010 and 393 beds in 2012, 1404 though its website now says 330 beds. Its bed utilization reportedly leads that of similar military organizations. Even without taking into account deflation of published transplant volumes, its total number of transplants performed is staggering. Other Notable Institutions and Individuals Tan Jianming, vice president of Fuzhou General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command, has led more than 4,200 kidney transplants as of 2014. Tan was previously also part-time director of the Urology and Transplantation Department at Shanghai Jiaotong Universitys First Peoples Hospital and its Shanghai Organ Transplant Center.140> Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, affiliated with the Second Military Medical University, hosts two prolific doctors: Zhu Youhua, who is considered a leader in the Peoples Liberation Army on kidney transplantation, had completed 3,680 kidney transplants by 2010.14 Fu Yaowen, the founder of the First Hospital of Jilin Universitys kidney transplantation program and blood purification center, had completed 3,000 kidney transplants as of April 2009. 407\nThe First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University has 8 chief and associate chief transplant surgeons (including two focusing on liver transplants), including Professor Zheng Keli, who has led more than 3,000 kidney transplants.1408 In a paper published in 2004, Yu Lixin, the director of the transplant department at Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, stated that the hospital had conducted 2,123 kidney transplants as of November 2001. The hospital consistently ranks second in the nation for the volume of kidney transplants performed.140? One particularly prolific institution is Xinqiao Hospital, affiliated with the Third Military Medical University. Its Renal Diseases Research Center claimed that it had conducted 2,590 kidney transplants by 2002... and once performed 24 kidney transplants in one day.!410 According to an introduction published by sohu.com on Aug 3, 2005, Guan Delin at Beijing Huaxin Hospital (First Affiliated Hospital of Tsinghua University) had experience in over 2,700 kidney transplants, over 40 kidney transplants from relative donors, and close to 20 combined kidney-pancreas transplants.!411 269 The Guangdong No.2 Provincial Peoples Hospital's organ transplant department was established in 1999. Its director Liu Dong had personally participated in more than 2,000 kidney and liver transplant surgeries as of 2015,.1412 Deputy director Wu Jiaging stated that, prior to August 3, 2006, the department had more than 10 organ transplant surgeries every day, and that around August 2006, patients from 8-9 countries came to the hospital for organ transplants, including from Singapore, Cambodia, and France.!413 The Navy General Hospital in Beijing has helped thousands of end-stage liver cancer patients gain a second life through liver transplantation.1414\nProfessor Wang Hongwei, director of the kidney transplant department at the Second Hospital of Shandong University, has participated in nearly 2,000 kidney transplants over the course of 20 years. He led his team once completed 10 kidney transplants in one day.!415 Deputy director Tian Chuan participated in nearly 1,000 kidney transplants. At Ruikang Hospital in Guangxi, Gu Xinwei, director of the transplant department, participated in 2,000 kidney transplants, over 200 liver transplants, and over 20 liver-kidney and multi-visceral transplants. 416 Tin Minzhuan, chief surgeon and guest professor at the hospital, has personally participated in close to 2,000 kidney transplants in 19 years. any The web page of He Xiaozhou, the president of the First Peoples Hospital of Changzhou, claims that he had personally led the department in conducting more than 1,700 kidney transplants.1*18 Some hospitals evidently had access to abundant organ sources. For example, the Peoples Liberation Army No. 458 Hospital (The Air Force Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command) had abundant cornea supplies that could not only provide for itself but also enable it to supply other hospitals. On May 15, 2011, the director of the ophthalmology department, Jing Lianxi, visited Purei Eye Hospital in Shanghai and promised to provide Purei with a stable supply of high-quality cornea transplant material.!419 4. AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF ORGANS a) Multiple Transplants for the Same Patient We have seen many instances in which multiple donor organs were procured for the same patient, either due to organ rejection or as spares. These cases include even third and fourth transplants and eight spare organs procured for the same patient. In 2006, a chief surgeon named Wang Guangce published a study analyzing 50 kidney re-transplant cases at the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. 142 Among the 50 cases, 46 were second transplants, 3 were third transplants, and one was a fourth transplant for the same patient. Five of the cases were orthotopic re-transplants within 10 days of the original transplant, and the duration between transplants and re-transplants ranged between 2 hours and 8 years. This indicates that, in 5 such cases, a second kidney was found and transplanted within 10 days. In at least one case, another kidney was found within 2 hours. Some transplants took the lives of 3-4 people. 270 In mainland China, it is not unusual to perform several transplant attempts for the same patient if the initial attempt is not successful. Every year, there are numerous cases where two, three, or even four transplant operations are performed for the same patient. For example, Shen Zhongyang at the Tianjin Orient Transplant Center performed two separate liver transplants for the movie star Fu Biao. Surgeon Zhu Tongyu at Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University performed kidney transplantation for the fourth time for the same patient. Shen Zhongyang stated that among its patients, the number of cases for his center to conduct secondary transplants for patients accounted for 10% to 20% of the total amount, due to improper handling or operation. 142! In April 2006, Huang Jiefu announced publicly at the National Liver Transplantation Symposium, \"Due to donor quality issues, mishandling during surgery, or other reasons, the number of secondary liver transplants increased in China. Strengthening and standardizing management of organ transplantation has become a top priority.\" 1422 Eight Kidneys for One Patient\nTan Jianming, vice president of the Fuzhou General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command, was reported to have completed more than 4,200 kidney transplants as of 2014.1423 Among his patients was a 35-year old male at Shanghai General Hospital in September 2003. In two weeks, Tan was able to acquire 4 kidneys and blood samples, but none of them matched (the authors speculate that the donors locations made it impractical to perform cross-matching before excising the donor kidneys). Later, in March 2004, Tan managed to obtain 4 more kidneys in a row for the same patient, the last of which matched successfully.", "tokens": 1690, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "Thus, 8 donor kidneys were excised for just one patient. On one occasion, a doctor showed the patient a 20+ page list of available donors and reassured him that many on the list would be suitable for him, and that he would receive a kidney if he continued to wait.1424 Two Spare Liver Donors Prepared for Demonstration According to the Chinese Nurse magazine, on September 28, 2005, Huang Jiefu, then-Deputy Minister of Health, accompanied Luo Gan, Secretary of the central Political and Legal Affairs Committee (Political and Legal Affairs Committee) and member of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, to attend the 50th anniversary celebration for the establishment of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. There, Huang Jiefu performed a liver transplant for a local Communist Party official, at The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University.!*2 He first planned to conduct an allogeneic transplant, for which a donor liver had been made available. Upon inspecting the patients body cavity, Huang found that an autologous transplant would be suitable. Nevertheless, he procured two spare livers for his demonstration- one from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, and another from the Liver Treatment Center of Chongqing Southwest Hospital, which is affiliated with the Third Military Medical University. 271\nWithin a few hours, each hospital had managed to find a donor with the same blood type and genetic loci. The next evening, those spare livers from both Chongqing and Guangzhou arrived in Xinjiang. Huang began the operation at 7 p.m. the next day and proceeded until the following morning at 10 a.m. After 24 hours of observation, Huang announced that the operation was successful and that the two spare livers were no longer needed. Because cold ischemia time for livers is limited to 15 hours,!42 the spare livers could only have been two living people waiting to be harvested; more than 60 hours had passed between procurement of the livers and the completion of the autologous transplant. b) Multiple Transplants Conducted Simultaneously On March 14, 2006 Guangzhou Daily reported: Recently, in the operation room of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, the reporter witnessed 5 liver and 6 kidney transplants being conducted simultaneously... At its height, this center performed 19 kidney transplants in one day. The record has been set for 6 liver transplants and one multi organ transplant in one day.!427 Xinqiao Hospital, affiliated with the Third Military Medical University in Chongqing, once carried out 24 kidney transplants in one day, and conducted 2,590 kidney transplants by 2002.1428 On December 1, 2008, Qilu Evening News reported that the General Hospital of Jinan Military Command was capable of performing 6 kidney transplants simultaneously. It set a national record of performing 16 kidney transplants within 24 hours. Its annual transplant volume has ranked among the nation's top 10 for 10 consecutive years. 1429 The Liver Transplant Center at West China Hospital has five full sets of imported liver transplant equipment, allowing five liver transplant operations to be performed simultaneously.!429 The Center once performed seven liver transplants in one day, setting a national record.!431\nOn February 18, 2014, sixteen doctors of the Hepatology Center at Fuzhou General Hospital of the Nanjing Military Command simultaneously carried out five liver transplants within seventeen hours.!432 This center claimed that it had performed the first, most, and best liver transplants in Fujian Province. According to the website of Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, on May 26, 2005 it completed one liver, 6 kidney, and 8 cornea transplants.!433 On September 3, 2005, it performed 7 heart, liver, and kidney transplants.!434 On April 28, 2006, the organ transplant center conducted 17 transplants in one day, including 7 advanced-stage uremic patients simultaneously. On the same day, it also completed two liver transplants and 8 cornea transplants. 1435 No. 474 Hospital of Lanzhou Military Command established its Organ Transplantation Blood Purification Center, which can carry out 12 kidney transplants at once.!*4%6 As early as in 2006, the president of Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Huang Zufa, said in an interview, Our hospital once performed 2 liver and 5 kidney transplants at the same time. We already have the ability to do 6 or 7 transplant surgeries at the same time.\" 1437 272 The organ transplant center at the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University once completed 7 transplants in one day, including 3 orthotopic liver and 4 kidney transplants. 1438 On January 17, 2006, Fuzhou General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command simultaneously carried out three liver transplants. 1439 On February 18, 2014, sixteen doctors completed five liver transplants within seventeen hours. 144\nNo. 181 Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command performed 8 transplant surgeries on December 30, 2012 alone, including heart, lung, kidney, liver, cornea, and islet cell transplants.1441 Beijing Chaoyang Hospital reportedly conducted 21 transplant surgeries within one day around 2000- 2001.1442 The founder of the transplant center at the Second Peoples Hospital of Shanxi, Wu Xiaotong, often spends 12 hours a day performing transplant surgeries, one after another. In August 2006, the center recorded over 100 patients waiting for transplants at any given time. On August 15 alone, the center conducted 11 kidney transplants.!443 At Wuxi Peoples Hospital, Chen Jingyu, the No. 1 Lung Transplant Surgeon in China, often completed four or five lung transplants a day.1444 The Cardiovascular Surgery Department and Organ Transplant Center at Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology set a national record of completing four heart transplants simultaneously on the same day.!44 At Shenzhen Sun Yat-sen Cardiovascular Hospital on September 30, 2003, chief surgeon Ji Shangyi and Yang Jianan completed two heart transplants in six hours, taking turns as lead surgeon.1446 \"Come as quickly as possible.

Some hospitals even claimed that they had ready donors available. Shanghai Changzheng Hospitals organ transplant department claimed on its application form for liver transplants in 2006 that the average waiting time for liver transplantation was one week,!*3 and that the shortest waiting time was 4 hours.!454 Between 2003 and 2006, the hospital had performed 120 emergency liver transplants. Within the last 9 days of April 2005, this hospital completed 16 liver transplants and 15 kidney transplants.149 Emergency liver transplants are performed on patients who require a transplant operation within 72 hours. Outside of China, finding donor organs for such emergency transplants is nearly impossible. According to the China Liver Transplant Registrys 2006 Annual Report,!4 among the 8,486 liver transplants performed in 29 facilities in China, 4,331 were labeled as either emergency or elective. Emergency transplants comprised 1,150 (26.6%) of the labeled cases.

All patients underwent transplants within 72 hours.1497\nIn the afternoon of February 14, 2014, Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital consecutively performed one liver and two kidney transplants. The liver transplant patient was transferred from another hospital in a hepatic coma for an 275 emergency transplant. The surgery began immediately after this patient was transferred to this hospital, indicating that the hospital has readily available liver sources. On September 4, 2012, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University performed a second heart transplant on the same patient, a rare surgery in the world and the second case in China. The donor heart matching and all other surgery preparation were completed in 4 days.148 Hebei Daily reported that, on April 7, 2011, vice president Liu Su of the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University led his expert group to perform a heart transplant for 13-year-old Hua Jiale.149 The hospital found a matching child donor for the patient in a week.

The entire liver transplant process took six hours. This case shows the existence of ready donors waiting.14 On January 28, 2002, Peoples Liberation Army No. 281 Hospital of Beijing Military Command undertook seven cadaveric renal allografts. One patient experienced a renal arterial embolization seven days after surgery, on February 4, 2002. The next day, the patient was administered a \"transplant nephrectomy and in situ re- transplantation.\" In other words, the wait time for the second transplant, including organ sourcing and tissue matching, took only one day.!*61\nAt one point, this hospital performed the most kidney transplants in the Beijing Military Command and in Hebei Province.!462 As of 2007, it has performed 6 to 9 simultaneous kidney transplants on 28 occasions.1!463 Some other hospitals also guaranteed to provide a second source within a week as a backup. For example, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese Medical University, Institute of Transplantation, China International Transplantation Network Assistance Center said that if a fatty liver or other anomalies are found during removal of the source organ, the recipients surgery would be canceled. The Center would offer the patient priority in finding another organ and schedule the surgery within a week. 1464 An article from the New Culture newspaper in Changchun City published on March 4, 2006 reported that The Second Hospital of Jilin University was able to find a heart donor for a patient named Xie Baoshi within one day and performed the transplant surgery for him the next day. It took the first team of doctors just 1.5 hours to get the heart from the donor 100 km away. Another team waiting at the Jilin hospital successfully transplanted that heart into the recipient 1.5 hours later.146 On May 30, 2014, Nanjing First Hospital performed two heart transplants simultaneously. According to a people.cn report on June 23, 2014, two patients surnamed Zhang and Li received notice at the same time on May 30 that donor hearts were available. The hospital's vice president Chen Xin decided that the two heart transplant surgeries would proceed simultaneously. That afternoon, the two patients entered operating rooms at the same time. It took half an hour to transport the donor hearts to the First Hospital. After Chen Xin installed a new heart for the first patient, he immediately installed a different heart for the second patient. The whole process took over two hours.!*66 276\nIn early September 2014, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University carried out liver transplants for two male patients on the same day, one of whom needed only one day to achieve a successful match. The patients family paid 600,000 RMB in cash, and the surgery was done the next day.!467 d) All types of transplants Complete Types of Transplants Performed Our survey of 165 hospitals from Chapters Two to Six showed that the vast majority of hospitals have expanded into multiple types of transplants beyond the ones for they have received permits from the Ministry of Health. Currently, the Ministry issues permits for six types of solid organ transplants (kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, and small intestine); cell and tissue transplants do not require permits. The most varied example is Peking University Third Hospital, which carried out transplants of heart, lung, cornea, stem cell, bone marrow, vascular grafts, and hair, besides organ transplants approved for liver, kidney, pancreas, and small intestine transplantseleven types in total, not including multi-organ transplants. Sun Yat-sen Hospital of Xiamen University is approved for only heart transplants, but it also performs nine other types of transplants: kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, lung, heart-lung, small intestine, islet cell, cornea, and bone marrow. Wuxi Peoples Hospital is approved for only lung transplants but also carries out eight other types-kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, cornea, stem cell, bone marrow, and vascular grafts.

These cases all featured fast availability of organs (most within a month) upon contacting a broker, as well as short hospitalization times (1-2 weeks for kidney transplants and 2-3 weeks for liver transplants). The hospitals either did not state the sources of donor organs or, when asked, said they came from executed prisoners. 281 Japanese Businessman: It Was So Fast I Was Scared When a native Japanese Hokamura Kenichiros kidneys failed, he waited over four years for a transplant before going online to check out rumors of organs for sale. 1468 He was astonished by just how easy it was. Ten days after contacting a Japanese broker in China in February, he was lying on an operating table in a Shanghai hospital receiving a new kidney. A doctor had only examined him that morning. It was so fast I was scared, he says. The price was 6.8 million yen (about US$80,000). It was cheap, says Hokamura. Hokamura is one of hundreds of well-off Japanese who have recently made the trip to China for kidney, liver or heart transplants, drawn by the availability of cheap, healthy organs and rapidly improving medical facilities along the east coast of the mainland. The so-called transplant tourism trade is also attracting a growing number of Koreans, Americans and other nationals. His broker has helped more than 100 Japanese make the trip to China for transplants since 2004, and the trade is growing. Hokamura negotiated the deal through a Japanese broker in Shenyang that operates under the name of the China International Organ Transplant Center which maintains a professional website with detailed information about their services for donors in English, Japanese, Korean and _ Russian. The _ website, //en.zoukiishoku.com//list/link.htm (accessed April 2, 2006) provides the following information on the sources of organs:\nIf you send your personal data to this center by e-mail or fax and accept the necessary body examination in Shenyang, China in order to assure a suitable donor, it may take only one month to receive a liver transplantation, the maximum waiting time being two months. As for the kidney transplantation, it may take one week to find a suitable donor, the maximum time being one month. The source of the organs, however, is not specified. This is a cover story of Japanese Flock to China for Organ Transplants posted on The Asia-Pacific Journal on April 2, 2006. Firsthand Accounts Below, we give several firsthand accounts of international patients who travelled to mainland China for organ transplants.!46? (To protect the identities of organ recipients, their real names have been removed.) Delegation of Nine Patients Receiving Transplants Together In January 2001, Mr. L expressed a wish to go to China for an organ transplant and had his blood drawn. About four to five days later, Mr. L received a phone call from the clinic that a matching kidney had been located in China, and that he could start to prepare for his trip. Mr. L hesitated at first and wondered how a matching organ could be found so swiftly. After discussing with his family members, he decided to go anyway. 282 On February 1, 2001, Mr. L's delegation of nine patients (5 male and 4 female) went together to Taiping Hospital of Dongyuan for organ transplants. After paying $130,000 HKD, Mr. L received a kidney transplant two days later, together with four other patients from southeast Asia. All 13 transplants (for the group of nine and the group of four) were finished within two days. Mr. L was hospitalized for seven days before returning home. Some patients were hospitalized for 14 days. Mr. L did not know which doctor operated on him, and no one mentioned the source of the organ. Mr. L suggested that hospitals in mainland China were participating in organ trafficking. Notes: Mr. L: male, age 57, blood type O, chronic renal failure\nTaiping Peoples Hospital of Dongguan (in Humen District, Dongguan City, Guangdong Province) was not a military hospital. However, Wei Gao, the chief physician of the transplant department, was also a professor of and chief physician at the Zhujiang Research Institute of the First Military Medical University.1479 Some other responsible people of this transplant department were also from military hospitals.

Z. was notified that a matched organ source had been located and she could go to China for the transplant. Not psychologically prepared for a matching organ to be found so quickly, she passed on this opportunity. After two weeks, the broker called again, saying that another matching organ had been found. This time, Ms. Rou. Z agreed to travel to mainland China for the transplant, and an operation was scheduled in late June. A group of seven patients went to China together for organ transplant. Each was asked to bring $200,000 HKD. The broker received the patients at the airport on June 25, 2001 and took them on a two-hour bus ride to Humen, Dongguan City.

By December 2004, her situation had deteriorated, and she developed renal failure and required dialysis. In early December of 2004, she was given a suggestion to go to mainland China for a transplant and was introduced to a broker, who took Ms. R.Z.s blood sample to mainland China on December 17, 2004. Two days later, on December 19, Ms. R.Z. was notified that a matching organ had been found that and she could travel immediately to Guangzhou for the transplant. As Ms. R.Z. had a bad cold at the time, she was only able to travel to Guangzhou with her husband and younger sister on December 24. The Economic and Technical Development Hospital of Guangzhou was situated far away from the city and was very desolate. The transplant department was on the tenth floor and had 13 rooms with three beds each. Each inpatient could have their family members live in the room with them. The chief physician of the transplant department was Lin Minzhuan. There were at least ten other patients waiting for transplants or recovering from one.

She was told by a doctor that she received a HLA 5 matched kidney. 284 In the next five days, she was hospitalized in an isolated care unit (the unit had six beds and monitored by staff 24 hours a day, with only one staff member at night). After that, she stayed in a regular room for seven days. She returned home after the stitches were removed on January 11, 2005. Doctor Claims Criminals Executed with Two Injections\nMr. J.C., in his fifties, was diagnosed with acute renal failure in January 2005. He received a hepatitis B vaccine in March and met the antibody requirements in September. He was told then that he could receive an organ transplant in mainland China. The patient received notification of an organ match on October 19, 2005. The patient attended a pre-trip seminar on October 20, 2005, where he and other patients were informed of the cost involved and told that their organs had all been matched, so there was no need to worry. The group of eight patients arrived at the Guangdong Province Border Patrol Armed Police Central Hospital in Shenzhen on October 26 at 4:10 p.m. Professor Wei Gao gave a pre-surgery seminar that evening. The surgery fee of $150,000 HKD in cash was collected from each patient. Some patients asked how the condemned criminals were executed. Dr. Gao said they were not shot; rather, they were given two injections (one for anesthetic and one painkiller) before the organs were taken. The patient paid $2,700 HKD for accommodation, $12,800 HKD for medicine, and 700 HKD for haemodialysis. The entire operation cost in mainland China was $169,019 HKD. According to the interviewee, the transplant hospitals in Mainland China do not issue receipts of payment for medical treatment; the hospital gives proof of medical treatment only when deemed absolutely necessary. They would provide the proof of the last two dialyses done before surgery, so that patients could apply for the public health insurance reimbursement after returning to Taiwan.

She got in touch with a local organ broker in November 2005. She had a pre-transplant evaluation and immunological evaluation at a local hospital and sent the results to the broker in early December. The broker asked Ms. T to prepare $26,000 USD in cash and told her that it usually took one week to find a matching organ. The broker also said it was preferred that the patient go to mainland China to wait for a matched organ. However, Ms. T expressed that she would like to wait for a matched organ to be located before leaving for mainland China. Ms. T was informed on January 4, 2006 that an organ source had been found and that her flight ticket was ready. On January 6, 2006, the broker took Ms. T and another organ transplant patient and flew to Wuhan in Hubei Province. Ms. T was hospitalized at 2 p.m. on the same day at the Land Force General Hospital of Wuhan and received a blood test immediately. She was sent to an operating room at 5 p.m. and received spinal anesthesia. She was sent out of the operating room at about 8 p.m. The doctor in charge of her case was Tang Ligong. There were three rooms for transplant patients, and each room had three patients; there were nine beds in total. She was told by a doctor that she received a HLA 3 matched organ. She was discharged on January 19, 2006 and returned to Taiwan. The Land Force General Hospital is a military hospital. The broker told Ms. T that the organ came from an executed prisoner (the same explanation generally given by hospitals in mainland China).

This was the first such operation in the world to take place at an altitude of 3,700 metres. The surgery took place at 15:00 on the 13th. The four surgeons included Tang Jinhai, dean of Lhasa People's Hospital, and Professor Yan Lvnan of West China Medical Center of Sichuan Medical University. The surgery lasted 14 hours. 1474 Dean Tang Jinhai said that the success of the operation sets an example for future medical research and practice in the plateau region, and puts an end to the part of Tibetan history that does not include major organ transplantation, and that it owes to the support of the Party. 1475 Tang Jinhai set out a significant detail of this operation. [Regarding] Lhasa being at an altitude of 3,600 meters: In order to ensure the activity of the livers hepatocytes, the extraction of the liver from the donor must take place simultaneously with the removal of the bad liver from the receiver. If the aircraft carrying the donor could not fly from outside the region to Tibet on time due to bad weather (such situations in Tibet are quite common during the winter), the consequences would be disastrous. This report illustrates that a living \"donor\" was killed when his/her liver was excised at the same time as the recipients bad liver was removed. It also indicates that transplants are performed in every corner of China, no matter how remote.", "tokens": 357, "label": "medium"}

WORKING AT FULL CAPACITY On January 12, 2015, Huang Jiefu appeared on Phoenix Television and addressed the limiting factors of organ transplantation in China: The first is an economic reason. A transplant surgery is very expensive, and not many citizens can afford the medical costs. The second is that, even though we have such well-qualified hospitals, there aren't that many experienced and skilled doctors. Only the third is that there are not that many donor bodies; even though donor bodies are abundant right now, there aren't that many hospitals and that many doctors that can [perform transplants].1476 In October 2015, Huang Jiefu told Beijing Youth Daily that China had only 169 hospitals with permits to perform one or more types of transplants. He expressed a desire to increase the number of qualified transplant hospitals from 169 to 300 and train 400 to 500 young doctors.!47 A more recent Xinhua report published in China Daily on May 15, 2016 stated that, according to Huang Jiefu, China will increase the number of hospitals conducting organ transplants to 300 in the next five years.!478 This suggests that the current system-wide capacity far from meets demand. Evidently, the availability of organs is not the main limitation. The continued expansion of existing transplant centers and plans to qualify so many new ones suggest that the number of transplant operations is constrained by medical facilities and personnel. a) High Bed Utilization We found a number of hospitals with bed utilization rates between 100% and 200%.", "tokens": 251, "label": "medium"}

Reading through the individual hospitals for the first time, we felt as if we were observing a monstrous flywheel. Case Study: Shanghai Renji Hospitals Surgery Building Busy 24 Hours a Day The Urology Department of Shanghai Renji Hospital established a new wing and renal transplant ward in Pudong in November 1999. It has expanded from its original 29 beds to 70 beds. Its new medical team and distribution system allowed its number of surgeries to increase by 300%.1499 Under the leadership of Professor Huang Yiran, the medium-sized department, with fewer than 70 beds, performs over 5,000 surgeries per year, with over 60% being large and extra-large operations. The average hospitalization time is five days.15 There are too many, too many patients! We have surgeries here overnight, nonstop for 24 hours a day, Dr. Cheng Zheying told a Wenhui Daily reporter in March 2016.159! Chen also said that the surgery building is the main battlefield for Renji Hospitals surgeries. As many as 120 surgeries are performed here in a day. The most difficult and advanced surgeries, including robotic surgeries, are all performed here. Each operation lasts over four hours, so even with the over ten operating rooms all open, doctors have to operate until late at night. This does not include liver transplants, as liver sources coming from other areas are often brought back to the hospital late at night, so it is quite common to conduct surgeries until early morning.

Rendering: Fuzhou General Hospital's new ward complex with 1,680 beds 298 d) Overworked Doctors and Nurses We observed that a number of medical teams and individual doctors struggled to carry out the volume of transplants demanded of them. The scale can be seen in surgeons working overtime to procure organs and conduct transplants, as well as departments carrying out multiple transplants simultaneously. One hospital even resorted to training almost all of its general surgeons to conduct organ transplants. Our survey of hospitals left us with the impression that the majority of hospitals and doctors have routinely been overloaded with transplant surgeries since 2000. Below are several examples: Working Around the Clock At the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, the director of the urological transplant department, Peng Longkai, has completed more than 2,000 kidney transplants. 1 One could observe the volume of transplants at this hospital from how busy its doctors were: Transplant surgeons often have to work for over 20 consecutive hours performing surgeries. They will start another round of operations after they rest for three or four hours. The surgeons are still at the operating table, while the scrub nurses have changed several shifts. They often conduct a dozen operations over a period of 2 to 3 days. They once performed 9 kidney transplants in one day. 167 Increased Workload A Major Test On April 10, 2008, head nurse Zhang Chunyan shared on Liaocheng Peoples Hospitals website, Our cardiac surgery departments nurses, while performing our duties during routine heart surgeries, are also responsible for postoperative for heart, liver, kidney, and lung transplants. During transplants, because of special aspects of the donor organs, we often need to do heart, liver, and kidney transplants simultaneously. This increased our workload more than ten-fold. Every person is overloaded with work every day and put in multiple times the effort. She included one example: In October 2005, we performed heart, liver, and kidney transplants in one day. This was a major test for us. The team first carried out the heart transplant, followed by kidney and then liver. Kidney Supply Chain Overwhelmed If Im not at the hospital, Im at the kidney procurement place. If Im not at the kidney procurement place, Im on the way between the hospital and the kidney procurement place. This was the portrayal of the busy lifestyle of the transplant team at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. Members of the team were often unable to go home for one or two weeks at a time. On December 26, a report on its official website stated: 1568 Due to the current international criticism of organ sourcing in China, the number of usable cadaveric donor kidneys has decreased significantly, causing an increase in uncertain factors and intense competition. However, due to the tireless efforts of Director Dong Laidong of the Organ Transplant Supply Department and Director Tian Jun of the Blood Purification Department, the number of cadaveric kidney transplants well surpassed that of last year, and the wait time for kidney transplants have not increased noticeably. 299 Ten Years Without Rest By the end of 2014, Shen Zhongyang, Director of Tianjin First Central Hospitals Oriental Organ Transplant Center, had performed close to 10,000 liver transplants.!? This hospital is the largest organ transplant center in Asia. A media report stated, As a leader, Shen Zhongyang pays a price that ordinary people cannot imagine. He has virtually no time for himself. In the past ten-plus years, he has basically gone from one thing to the next, day and night, he hasnt had a single meal at regular times, and hes often at the operating table until midnight or the following morning.17\nOther transplant doctors also have not rested: The hospitals transplant surgery divisions doctors hurriedly shuttle between wards and operating rooms, with no time to greet one another. They kept saying, These few days are crazy busy, with more than a dozen surgeries a day. Some doctors were even rushing surgeries all night long [and] did not sleep at all.\" Doctors complain that the off-season is only a month after the New Year; they are busy until the end of the year and normally dont go home.!971 Under Shen Zhongyangs guidance, each of his former young doctors has independently completed nearly 1,000 liver transplant surgeries.1572 Dongfeng Company Hospital This fervor in pushing transplant volume is not limited to national-level hospitals. We have found that transplantation has become a major business activity for municipal hospitals and subsidiary hospitals of state- owned enterprises, as exemplified by the case below: The Dongfeng Company Hospital is operated by an automaker in Shiyan, a small industrial city in central China. In less than ten years, the explosive growth in this hospitals transplantation activities caused the local Wa economy to prosper, elevated the citys reputation, and gradually replaced the Dongfeng vehicle as the new pusiness card of Shiyan.173 As early as in August 2000, it conducted 10 kidney transplants, one thyroid transplant, and 3 cornea transplants in the same day. The hospital also performs liver, cornea, in situ parathyroid, bone marrow, and other types of organ and tissue transplants. 1574 The hospitals vice president Yuan Fangjun stated in 2009, Kidney transplantation is now a routine surgery. Almost all surgeons at our hospital can independently complete kidney transplants.", "tokens": 1298, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "1575 According to the hospitals website, it has 10 surgical departments and more than 100 surgeons. How many transplants is the hospital performing to necessitate training almost all of its surgeons in the procedure? In addition, the hospital has a breast transplant department with more than 40 beds, 3 chief physicians, 2\nassociate chief physicians, 4 attending physicians, and 3 residents.!76 These doctors web pages are no longer accessible. 300 e) Continued Growth Since 2006 After the 2006 publicity surrounding live organ harvesting, the Party/Government indicated that transplant numbers had gradually decreased. Yet, that was not the case. There has been continued expansion of transplant hospitals after 2006. New Ministry Approval System The Government blamed the chaotic market for live organ harvesting. To recertify and regulate the market, the Ministry of Health started to issue permits to transplant centers, and hospitals without permits would no longer be allowed to continue conducting organ transplants after July 1, 2007. In July 2007, more than 1,000 transplant hospitals in China applied for permits under this new system, including nominally unrelated hospitals of traditional Chinese medicine or occupational diseases.!57 Only 164 received permits. This meant that the Government could monopolize and redistribute the organ market. As a result, large transplant centers faced less competition and achieved even greater development than before. We observed that some institutions that did not receive permits either reduced their transplant volumes, stopped performing transplants, or operated under increased secrecy. Nevertheless, many that did not have permits but were able to obtain organs continued to operate. In fact, the Ministry of Health had not really closed the door to hospitals that had not obtained approval for transplants in 2007; the Ministry later introduced pilot programs for donation after cardiac death, and these hospitals were encouraged to apply for approval after procuring five or ten transplants from donation after cardiac death. 178\nBy January 2014, the approval list had been expanded to 169 hospitals.17? Among the five newly added centers is the First Hospital of Foshan, which was limited to liver and kidney transplants from donors with no cardiac activity. Based on its website archived on November 1, 2012, before being approved,!59 it had launched not only kidney, liver, heart, lung, kidney-liver, and pancreas-kidney transplants but also living-donor liver transplants. The website stated that within 24 hours on December 28, 2004, this hospital performed 5 kidney and 2 liver transplants.18! On March 1, 2005, its entire transplant team cooperated to perform 2 liver and 6 kidney transplants within 8 hours, from eleven oclock in the morning to seven in the evening.!82 On December 29, 2005, its transplant center completed 7 kidney transplants.1583 The hospital's website has not published its transplant numbers after the publication of the Matas/Kilgour Report in 2006. However, its addition to the list of approved hospitals in 2013 indicates that it continued its transplant operations after 2011.", "tokens": 479, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "Similar situations occurred with the other four newly added transplant centers. We further found that at least 75 non-approved hospitals were issued permits for pilot runs of transplants from DCD starting in 2011 and continued to perform transplants. . 301 Stable Growth Party-controlled media claimed that organ transplants had been drawn down or stopped, that there were not as many organs available, and that transplant hospitals could hardly sustain themselves. The transplant hospitals also removed or tampered with related websites and information regarding the number of transplants performed, and either falsified or stopped updating their reported data. Contrary to the message from the Government, we observed that the scale of organ transplantation in mainland China in general has not been declining; rather, it has entered a period of stable development. The Chinese Government issued statements that the scale of organ transplantation has decreased since 2006. For example, on December 18, 2007, Southern Weekend published an article entitled China calls for a halt to organ transplant tourism. 184 The article stated that the largest organ transplant center in Asia, Tianjin Oriental Organ Transplant Center, saw a sudden drop in the number of transplants performed since 2007 due to a lack of donor availability. The article also stated that in the first half of the year, the center had only 15 liver transplants, all of which were from patients relatives. Yet, it bears repeating that the Tianjin Oriental Organ Transplant Center opened a new transplant building in September 2006 with a capacity of 500 beds. Its number of transplant teams also increased from 7 to about 17.1585 Seven months earlier, a report in the February 2006 issue of the Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine in Intensive and Critical Care had set out, \"The newly completed Oriental Transplant Center building has 700 beds...[and] currently has 310 medical professionals. The center plans to focus on liver and kidney transplants continuously and form an integrated transplant center which is the best in Asia and world- famous. 1586 By 2013, the hospital's overall bed utilization rate had increased to 131%.187 Based on developmental needs, the hospital added 300 beds and adjusted the number allocated for several departments, including the organ transplant center. The First Affiliated Hospitals Liver Transplant Center of School of Medicine at Zhejiang University stated on their official website on February 28, 2011, Our countrys liver transplantation business has entered a period of stable development. Under the leadership of academician Zheng Shusen, the liver transplant business at First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University is flourishing. It moved into a new building in 2007. Liver transplantation has become more systematic, professional, and large-scale. 1588 302 Chapter Eight: Cover Up ASSESSING COVER UP\nFor Communists, statistics are the pursuit of politics by other means. Statistics in China may be accurate, but only if the Party believes that their accuracy serves some political purpose. Determining the accuracy of Chinese Statistics, when the source data on which the statistics are based are not available, requires evaluation. For organ transplant statistics, the Communist system has had competing political considerations. One has been to show how advanced they were in transplant technology, a consideration which pushed them in the direction of large numbers. The other was not to create undue suspicion about sources, which pushed them in the direction of lower numbers. The first tendency prevailed initially, leading to generation of inexplicably large number of transplants. The Party then realized that this manner of boasting was causing them a political problem, because it raised the question of the sources of all these organs, when they had no donation system and no national organ distribution system. They were stuck with the numbers they had produced.", "tokens": 617, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "But, once they realized that those numbers were creating a problem for them, the numbers stopped increasing. This is a simple enough analysis when we are looking only at national figures.", "tokens": 31, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Once we start to look at local figures, the analysis gets more complicated. Individual hospitals are less concerned about accounting for sourcing since, at least to date, there has been no international focus on their numbers. The tendency for individual hospitals to generate large numbers for boasting purposes is accordingly not as constrained as the national Party tendency is. The numbers we get for transplants from individual hospitals, when added up, far exceed the totals coming from the national system. But, we had to ask ourselves, how much of this is just touting, the fiddling with Statistics at a local level, generated by different political considerations than operated nationally? As the reader can see, we have answered this question by looking, hospital by hospital, at a wide variety of other factors besides what hospitals claim there transplant numbers to be. We looked, for instance, at bed numbers. Bed numbers give us totals for physical entities and are likely to be accurate. Yet, they are not in isolation a perfect indicator of transplant numbers because beds are fungible and can be used for non- transplant purposes. This is less likely in a transplant hospital or a transplant wing of a hospital, but still possible. Even if beds are used only for transplants, we need to make allowances for use of beds for waiting and recovery times, which are not fixed. We also looked at staff numbers. Again these are numbers of physical entities and themselves likely to be accurate. Presumably transplant staff are hired to work. Yet, numbers of staff do not tell us about the rate of work.", "tokens": 268, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "303 We looked at grants and awards. Grants and awards are indicators of activity.", "tokens": 14, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Award citations or acceptances may mention a figure. But is the recipient here too just boasting in order to justify the award? Grants may mention a projected figure. But is the projection realized? We looked at publications, both newsletters and research studies.", "tokens": 42, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Again, we had to evaluate what those newsletters and research studies produced. Chinese organ transplant research is mostly not published in reputable journals, because those journals mostly reject research which relies on organs from sources not demonstrably proper. Chinese organ transplant research is often vanity published by journals attempting to give respectability to those researchers despite their inability to demonstrate proper sourcing of organs. The result of these considerations means that no one piece of evidence for any hospital can tell us with certainty what its transplant volume is. Rather, as we did for our previous research, we suspended coming to any conclusion until we looked at all the data. What that data tells us consistently, hospital by hospital, looking at all factors in combination, is that transplant volumes in China are far larger than the official national figures.", "tokens": 139, "label": "light"}
{"text": "The inclination of individual hospitals to engage in competitive boasting cannot alone account for the discrepancy between the total of local figures and national figures. The discrepancy is too consistent, over too many variables, for that. There may, on the contrary, be a greater likelihood of accuracy locally than nationally because the temptation to downplay figures in order not to raise questions about sources has been less likely to hold sway locally than nationally. The claims of local hospitals that they are transplanting huge numbers do not have to be taken at face value. That is one reason why we have not come up with a specific figure about transplant volumes. But they surely make ever more urgent the need to comply with the duties of transparency, openness to scrutiny and accountability. The large numbers the national system produces already impose the need to comply with those duties. The much larger numbers the totals which individual hospitals, in combination, claim impose this duty of compliance with even more force. Over time, instead of increasing transparency, China has been going in the opposite direction, increasing opacity. There has been increasing cover up; the Party/State wants to hide something.", "tokens": 197, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "What it wants to hide we can often see, because the Party/State has been systematically blocking our reports and taking down sources we cite from their websites. The fact that our reports and their own data sources which we use to substantiate our work systematically disappear once we use them does not indicate that what is blocked and deleted is true. But it does show that what is blocked and deleted does not coincide with the current political stance of the Party. Cover up tells a story, a story of what the Party does not want us to see. In this chapter we tell that story. DELETION OF INFORMATION FROM TRANSPLANT ORGANIZATIONS WEBSITES A number of hospital and transplant organization webpages and even websites were deleted after the Kilgour/Matas report was released in 2006. In addition, we observed that some hospitals have merged their dedicated transplant departments and centres back into their parent departments (hepatobiliary surgery, 304 urology, etc.). The more generic departmental structure obfuscates any information remaining regarding transplant capacity and resources. @ PES SHSeiES3= Mozilla Firefox petite File Edit View History Bookmarks Tools Help Related Links\n- - C fey (LM | nttp://web.archive.org/web/20051201024138/www.cstx.org/xhjj2.htm 2) Most Visited 4 Getting Started | Latest Headlines LE RAS | SRA | Eee ll Ret Ul Cee | | fel DBF BREE SKE FPoasz PHA FE Beet BR FRORAMK SEH #2 Om ee RIK AP TPB sa | (REA 7 =O = ee ee A a ee a SRILA = Kae ABS EAZTM 4 BM it m- & St OBA NIST a ee Figure 8.1: The Chinese Medical Association Society of Transplantation website, before it was taken down in April 2006.

HOSPITAL UNDERREPORTING The Ministry of Health issued two regulations showing widespread, extensive underreporting by transplant centres in mainland China: The Ministry of Health Medical Regulation Notice (2009) #55 included a zero-tolerance policy of suspending the transplant approval of any hospital found not to be complying with human organ transplant reporting requirements. The Ministry of Health Medical Regulation Notice (2010) #105 requires reporting within 72 hours after performing a transplant surgery. Hospitals found to be in violation would have their transplant qualifications suspended. After these notices were issued, has the situation changed? In April 2011, The Economic Observer's report titled Who can solve the difficulties in organ donation in China? showed wide gaps between the reporting and registration system used by transplant centres and transplant numbers in reality.197\nThe article cited an example in which Tianjin First Central Hospital (Oriental Organ Transplant Centre) registered only 7 liver transplants (including from living and cadaveric donors) in 2010, yet its public liver transplant figure was 330. Hospital president Shen Zhongyang and Wang Haibo, who manages the national liver transplant registry at Hong Kong Universitys Queen Mary Hospital, both declined to explain this discrepancy. Per our earlier analysis, this hospital's transplant volume is at least 6,000 to 8,000 per year and may reach as high as 7,800 to 10,400 per year. Its registered volume is not even a tiny fraction of its actual transplants performed. Yet, its transplant centre claims to have performed the most transplants in the country and ranked first in the registration system consistently for more than a decade. This suggests that other transplant centres might have registered even fewer than 7 transplants per year. From this example, we can see that underreporting among Chinas transplant centres can be described as severe. The transplant statistics reported by the authorities are far from reality. One reason for Shen Zhongyang and Wang Haibos silence is that these huge volumes of transplants simply cannot be accounted for by organ donations (more details are available in the Donation after cardiac death section). Even so, the liver transplant registrys situation may not be the worst; the kidney transplant data centre, managed by the Peoples Liberation Army No. 309 Hospital (Peoples Liberation Army General Staff Department Hospital) does not provide public data at all.1598 Shi Bingyi, director of the hospitals Peoples Liberation Army Organ Transplant Centre, stated that its data systematically covers all hospitals in the country qualified to conduct kidney transplants, including sources of organs. However, it denied an Observer reporters data request, stating that none 308 of the data is public; to see [the data], one must obtain approval from OTC [Ministry of Health Human Organ Transplant Technology Clinical Application Committee]. CAUSES OF UNDERREPORTING\nWu Mengchao stated in an interview with iNewsweek.cn on February 23, 2006, There are problems with the organ sources, so its hard to organize cases after performing [transplants], and we cant publish papers.1599 Tax evasion has become a common practice for enterprises and institutions in mainland China. In addition to the financial aspect, transplant centres also maintain two sets of books when it comes to transplant volume.", "tokens": 536, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "In the industrys early period of growth after 2000, because transplant volume was limited by technology and price of immunosuppressants, hospitals and doctors engaged in high-profile publicity to attract patients. Along with the quick reduction of such bottlenecks, transplant volume increased. For self-financed hospitals, how to protect this surge in profit from taxes became a practical problem. Underreporting transplant volume became a solution. To what extent was it implemented? As mentioned earlier, the Oriental Organ Transplant Centre performs thousands of transplants per year but reported only 7 liver transplants to the registry in 2010. We also examined such a scenario at Peking University People's Hospital. As of July 16, 2014, its website stated that since 2000, the hospital has carried out 600 liver and 510 kidney transplants in total. Since it became an approved transplant centre in 2007, it has performed 80 to 90 transplants per year. 160 In other words, as of 2014, Peking University Peoples Hospital performed fewer than 1,200 liver and kidney transplants in over a decade. This can be considered its public record. However, in an interview with China Economic Weekly, Zhu provided an entirely different picture: Before the 2010 pilot [donation] program started in 2010, all of our organ sources came from executed prisoners. Our hospital once did more than 4,000 liver and kidney transplants in one year. These organs all came from executed prisoners. 1601\nZhu was describing events before 2010. The hospitals transplant centre moved into its new 470-bed surgery building in December 2005; its website now claims 120 to 130 liver and kidney transplants per year,!92 which is only 1/33 the number stated by Zhu Jiye. It is unlikely that a transplant centre with 470 beds would perform only 120 to 130 surgeries per year. In another example, a senior military doctor who belonged to the General Logistics Department of the Shenyang Military Command wrote to the Epoch Times on March 31, 2006, The number of underground transplants performed in China exceed the public figures by several times. For example, if the official number is 30,000 cases, then the actual number would be 110,000. This is also the root cause of plummeting prices of organ transplants in China...Because there is a huge source of living organs, many military hospitals report their transplants to their supervising authorities. At the same time, they also carry out organ transplants on a large scale in private. This leads to the fact that the actual numbers are much higher than the official statistics.\"16 309 Having analyzed this pattern among the 165 hospitals in Chapters Two to Six, we present a series of representative case studies in the Falsifying Transplant Data section. THE PRETENSE OF DONOR TRANSPLANTS Many hospitals now list living-donor and donation after cardiac death transplants as their signature services or even main organ sources. However, we found that the actual number of donations is extremely low. a) Living Relative-Donor Transplants In 2003, Jiangsu Province Hospital designated its liver transplant centre as the priority of priorities for development into a nationally known discipline. Within three years, the hospital, the provincial government, and the provincial health department provided tens of millions of RMB in development funds. In the span of three to four years, its Liver Surgery Department grew from nonexistence into one of the five largest liver transplant research centres in the country.164", "tokens": 557, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "In 2005, the centre became the Chinese Living-Donor Liver Transplant Research Institute, with two wards, 100 beds, and a laboratory centre. In the same timeframe, its urologic surgery department had 94 beds, and its cardiothoracic surgery department had 120 beds.!5 With surgery costs of one-eighth to one-tenth that of similar procedures outside of China, it has attracted many patients from overseas. Its liver transplant centre had 100 beds by 2005, yet claimed that it can perform 80 to 100 liver transplants each year. However, this annual volume would require no more than 8 beds. The centre has always featured living relative-donor transplants as its signature service. However, in July 2003 it claimed that, among the 100 liver transplants it had completed, 26 involved living donors, that these 26 represented 60% of all living-donor transplants, and that it performed the most living-donor liver transplants in the country.!% This leaves the sources of the other 74 transplants unaccounted for; it also implies that there had been fewer than 50 living relative-donor transplants in all of China. According to the Foshan First Peoples Hospital, China had more than 200 living-donor kidney transplants in 2001, and the living-donor ratio increased to 4% of 7,000 kidney transplants in 2004. As of 2005, the Wuhan Tongji Hospital Organ Transplantation Research Institute had completed 85 living relative-donor kidney transplants, the most in China. Jiangsu Provincial Hospital had also performed more than 50 such transplants. The ratio of living relative-donor transplants was still far lower than that of Western countries, Japan, Korea (averaging 90%), and Hong Kong and Taiwan (averaging about 20%).1607\nAccording to Zheng Shusen, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, China performed its first living- donor liver transplant in 1995, but the number was far behind that of liver transplants with deceased donors; between 1995 and 2005, there were only 73 living-donor liver transplants in total [note: this number differs from the 2001 figure mentioned earlier].16%8 On March 26, 2012, JCRB.com (managed by the Supreme People's Procuratorate) published a report titled Defendant of Beijings Largest Organ Trade Case: Donors Are Almost All Fake Relatives. The report covered a 310 case involving an underground kidney broker, Cai Shaohua (defendant), who said that doctors told them that the matching rate between relatives was very low; even if there is a marginal match, it could result in complications after surgery, which would only cause bigger losses for the patients finances and health. Now [among relative-donor]| organ transplant surgeries, nine out of ten are fake relatives. Those in the hospitals are well aware of the things that we [brokers] do, said Cai.169 b) Donation after cardiac death (DCD) Transplants Zhongnan Hospital affiliated with Wuhan University became the first unit approved by the Ministry of Health to perform transplants using donations after cardiac death (DCD). Vice President Ye Qifa, the Executive Chairman of the China Organ Transplant Alliance, was one of the most important proponents of Chinese donation after cardiac death operations, of which his team has performed the most. Huang Jiefu called this team the domestic icon of the donation after cardiac death field.1! Ye's team has successfully launched 23 new technologies and businesses. It has received more than 10 national and provincial science and technology awards and more than 10 million RMB in research funding.114\nThe transplant surgery department performs conventional liver, kidney, pancreas, small intestine, combined kidney and liver, allogeneic liver cell, spleen cell, and islet cell transplants. It claims that its total donation after cardiac death transplant volume ranks sixth in the country. Its clinical department (including liver and gallbladder transplants) has more than 150 specialist beds and 10 ICU beds. 1612 Yet, because tradition requires bodies to be preserved intact after death, China has neither related legislation nor significant voluntary organ donation. According to Chen Zhonghua, the first Executive Chairman of the Organ Donation Management Commission of China,!!3 between 2003 and August 2009, only 130 citizens successfully donated their organs after death in mainland China.16!4 In April 2011, the Ministry of Health began pilot programs for donation after cardiac death at some 3A hospitals.1615 In this context, donation after cardiac death refers to organs donated systematically through the Red Cross Society of China (though whether the participating hospitals followed these regulations is another discussion). In 2010, the Ministry of Health asked the Red Cross to establish pilot organ donation programs in 11 provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, Nanjing, and Wuhan.!6!6 The Ministry of Health stipulated that hospitals that complete more than 10 such donations and their respective transplant surgeries within the pilot period could report to the Ministry of Health through provincial health administrative departments, to gain Ministry approval for donation after cardiac death transplants.16! 618 Those that already had the provincial level permit for transplant and complete 5 transplants from donations after cardiac death within the same period could report to the Ministry of Health through provincial health administrative departments and obtain approval from OTC [Ministry of Health Human Organ Transplant Technology Clinical Application Committee]. '' A year after the pilot programs were started, 46 people nationwide successfully donated their organs, far from meeting clinical needs. In 2011, the Ministry of Health expanded pilot programs from 11 provinces and cities to 21. 311\nThe one-year pilot period was later extended to at least two years. In 2013, the Ministry of Health claimed that hospitals from 19 provinces and cities were participating, but it did not release a list of such hospitals. On March 22, 2012, the National Human Organ Donation Pilot Program Wrap-Up Meeting was held in Hangzhou. The Red Cross announced that, in the two years after the pilot programs began, China completed 207 donations [after cardiac death].1621 Divided among the more than 147 hospitals that did not receive approval in 2007 but had donation after cardiac death pilot programs, this amounts to an average of less than one donation after cardiac death case per year per hospital. In August 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission released the list of 165 hospitals nationwide that had been approved for transplants. Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University had been added to the list because it exceeded the requirements for donation after cardiac death transplants. According to Huang Jiefu, Zhongnan Hospital completed more than 20 donation after cardiac death donations and transplant surgeries during the pilot period (2011 to August 2013) and became the first among donation after cardiac death pilot hospitals to gain Ministry approval. He added that future transplants at this hospital would all come from voluntary and post-death donations. Later, four more transplant centres received approvals for transplants in 2013 and the original list has been finally expanded to 169 transplant-approved hospitals. As of February 2016, we searched online and found 75 hospitals that have received permits for donation after cardiac death pilot programs. These hospitals are located in 19 provinces and directly-controlled municipalities. It is apparent that most of these hospitals could not achieve the minimum requirement of 5 or 10 donations after cardiac death to get approved during the pilot period. If Zhongnan Hospitals transplants really come from voluntary and post-death donors as Huang Jiefu had claimed, these 20+ transplants would have been accommodated by a single bed. Were almost all of the 150 specialist beds and 10 ICU beds sitting empty these few years? Ye Qifa reported that 4,626 citizens in China donated their organs after death between 2010 and August 2015. Even if this number is true, it cannot cover the needs of even this one hospital with its transplant bed count. c) The Pretense of Multiple Organs from One Donor Government of China Health officials sometimes use the potential to procure multiple organs from the same donor to explain the gap between the number of organ sources (including voluntary donors and executed prisoners) and its official number of transplants. However, this efficiency cannot be applied in most cases. According to a Guangxi News report, on December 14, 2012, more than 60 doctors carried out 6 transplant surgeries simultaneously at No. 303 Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command on that day. These included liver, lung, pancreas-kidney, and kidney transplants, as well as two cornea transplants.!622 Dr. Sun Xuyong, president of the hospitals Transplantation Research Institute, stated that the six organs were procured from the same donor, but did not explain the source of the donor. Lan Liugen, deputy director of the surgery division, indicated in March 2013 that only two hospitals in China had this capability at that time; the other was the Tongji Organ Transplant Research Institute of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. 312 d) Deflated Bed Counts Some large hospitals publish extremely low bed counts in their surgical departments compared to their scale. Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology is the nations largest and earliest comprehensive medical facility and research institute specializing in clinical application and experimental research of organ transplantation. It is capable of carrying out heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas transplants, combined pancreas-kidney, liver-intestine, and multiple abdominal organ transplants, among other difficult and complicated clinical transplants.123 The current website of its Organ Transplant Institute claims that its transplantation program, total number of cases, and long-term survival rate have continuously led the nation over the past 50 years. It reportedly performed more than 500 liver transplants and nearly 3,000 kidney transplants during these five decades. It lists 65 beds and 65 research personnel under its organ transplant research institute. 124 Yet another introductory webpage for its key specialty department, The Organ Transplant Basic Research Center, says that the clinical department currently has a 2,400-square-meter dedicated transplant ward designed for 86 beds.1625 In November 2011, Sina Global News reported that the best-known facility is Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology carries out thousands of kidney transplant surgeries annually and has the most donor transplant recipients waiting for kidney transplants in the country.1626 Averaging the 3,500 total transplants over 16 years (conservatively assuming a negligible volume before 1999) would yield just over 200 transplants per year, which would require no more than one-third of its claimed bed count. Furthermore, 65 beds would allow the institute to conduct more than 1,000 kidney transplants per year, assuming a three-week hospitalization period and full utilization. Thus, if the institute carries out thousands of kidney transplants per year, its true bed count is likely several times higher. The General Hospital of Shenyang Military Command stated that it has \"one of the best-known transplant centres in the country,\" and that since it successfully carried out the first kidney allograft in August 1978, the hospital has completed more than 1,700 kidney transplants. The centre claims to have 36 inpatient beds. 1627 This volume of less than 100 per year does not match its high status in the country. The First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University's website claims that since 1999, the hospital has witnessed a period of glorious development in kidney transplantation. As early as June 2000, it said it had completed over 1,140 kidney transplants.!28 However, this hospital was tracked by overseas media since the release of the Matas/Kilgour report in 2006. It has since tried to hide the number of transplants performed, and lists on its website only that it has 48 beds. However, when our investigator called the transplant department under the guise of introducing a patient on behalf of another hospital and inquired whether the department had enough beds, its medical personnel indicated that there was no need to worry, and that they could add beds if needed and even appropriate beds from other wards. 313 FALSIFIED TRANSPLANT DATA The No. 81 Hospital of Nanjing Military Region in a patient counseling article on website published in August 2010, Wang replied to a patient, To date, our centre has done more than 300 clinical liver transplants of various types, one liver-kidney transplant, 10 emergency liver transplants, and 10 relative-donor liver transplants. 1629\nOn May 24, 2014, an introduction on the hospitals website showed that it was able to perform two liver transplants simultaneously. It became one of the main bases for liver transplantation in eastern China. The hospital has completed more than 300 combined liver-kidney transplants, including 15 emergency liver transplants. 1639 A June 2014 report by the Nanjing Morning News, Wang said the hospital has performed more than 200 transplants since its first liver transplant in 2003.1631 The cumulative figure on its website for 2014 was the same as for 2010, and the number Wang provided in 2014 was 100 fewer than that in 2010. The figure of 300 total cases is equivalent to fewer than 30 cases each year, in which case only two beds and one surgeon would be needed. Tianjin First Central Hospitals Oriental Organ Transplant Centre is the largest in Asia and has ranked first in China in cumulative volume of transplants performed since it was established in 1998.1632 Liver and kidney transplants became the centre's routine surgeries in 1999,1633 The centre's archived web pages show that it broke ground on its new building in 2002. The construction was funded by the Tianjin municipal government. The new building had 500 transplant beds, and the Centre aimed for 500 liver transplants and 300 kidney transplants per year.1!34+ This implies that each transplant bed would accommodate fewer than two patients per year.

(AF AER) Figure 8.3: The screenshot of the special interview with Shen Zhongyang in February 2006 by the Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine in Intensive and Critical Care\nAccording to a special interview with Shen Zhongyang in February 2006 by the Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine in Intensive and Critical Care, the newly completed Oriental Transplant Centre building had actually opened with 700 beds.!35 This was 200 more than the announced bed count in the report in September, 2006. 1636 And the centre could simultaneously carry out nine liver transplants and eight kidney transplants. 1637 By October 2009, its bed utilization rate reached 90% 1638 and 131% in 2013 before it added more beds. 1639 Even if we count it as 500 beds, when it achieved a 100% bed utilization rate (around 2010 by its growth trend), with an average liver transplant hospitalization time of 3 to 4 weeks,!4 the transplant volume may have reached 6,000 to 8,000 per year. With its 131% bed utilization rate in 2013, the corresponding annual volume may have been as high as 7,800 to 10,400. Yet the current official website shows only 120 transplant surgery beds and seven liver and kidney transplant teams. This bed count is even fewer than that before the new building was put into use in 2006.14! In 2010, the hospital publicly claimed 330 liver transplants but reported only 7 to the official liver transplant registry.1*2 The centre claims that it has completed 10,000 organ transplants in total.143 However, this number would have been easily surpassed by just a few of its doctors: 315 e The centres director Shen Zhongyang had reportedly completed close to 10,000 liver transplants himself by 2014.1644 His colleagues and the majority of the doctors he had trained had each independently completed over 1,000 transplants.1645\nBy 2011, Vice President Zhu Zhijun had completed 1,400 liver transplants and 100 liver transplants from relative donors.16*6 Deputy director Cai Jinzhen has completed 1,500 liver transplants.147 By July 2006, associate chief surgeon Pan Cheng had independently completed over 1,000 liver transplants and participated in over 1,600 liver graft procurements.1648 Chief surgeon Song Wenli from the renal transplant department had completed over 2,000 kidney transplants and over 100 combined transplants.1!*9 Associate chief surgeon Mo Chunbo has completed over 1,500 kidney transplants.16 Chief surgeon Gao Wei had completed over 800 liver transplants and 100 from relative donors after he graduated from the university. He joined the Oriental Organ Transplant Centre in 1999,1651 In 2006, the centre had 310 medical professionals.!>2 The total number of transplants performed by this centre is huge. The First Peoples Hospital of Yunnan Province hospital successfully completed the world's first pediatric heterotopic liver transplant (the donor liver was partially cut to reduBce the liver volume and was implanted in the spleen nest). It boasts to have reached an advanced level both nationwide and in Yunnan Province in the field of organ transplantation.13 It website has deleted the introduction to its organ transplantation department. Based on a version saved on transplantation.org.cn on January 9, 2014, the hospital claimed to have conducted 18 liver transplants between April 2005 and February 2014, and 21 liver transplants to date.16>4\nHowever, we found a liver transplant study published by one of its doctors, for which the patient sample size was six times the number of transplants that the hospital had claimed. These samples were only a small portion of a large number of transplants that met the study criteria. Therefore, the hospitals actual number of liver transplants is most likely well above six times the official number. For example, Mo Yiwo, current director of hepatobiliary surgery, published a study that he conducted on eight piggyback orthotopic liver transplants between August 2000 and July 2002 (23 months).!> Another doctor from the hospital published a paper about lung infections in 55 orthotopic liver transplant patients between April 2005 and May 2007.16 Zeng Zhong, deputy director of the transplantation centre, published a paper about biliary reconstruction of orthotopic liver transplant patients between April 2005 and March 2007,1697 Another paper randomly selected 12 orthotopic liver transplant patients who underwent the surgery at the hospital between 2007 and 2009.1658 The online profile of the hospitals transplantation department states that it has conducted 41 kidney transplants since 1983, including 17 with living relative donors.1? However, doctors at the hospital published a study in 2008 based on 50 living relative-donor kidney transplants between February 2002 and May 2008.19 Based on this number, in the six-year period between 2002 and 2008, the number of living relative-donor kidney transplants is three times the hospitals total claim for the 33-year period. Another study was based on a sample of 18 out of 84 kidney transplants.16! From these fragments, one can see that the public transplant volume has been severely deflated. 316\nThe kidney transplant department of Zhengzhou No.7 Peoples Hospital was established in 1987 and performed kidney allografts relatively early in China. It claims that its quantity and quality of kidney transplants in the past 20 years ranks first in Henan Province.!62 According to the kidney transplant departments website, Since the establishment of our specialist department, we have conducted more than 2,000 kidney transplants.

Figure 8.4: The Update of the Kidney Department According to an update published by the kidney transplant department on March 31, 2015:1664\nIn 2014, our department completed over 50 kidney transplants, leading the entire province. Size of the department: there are 46 approved beds, but the number of patients is now usually maintained at 70 or more. The bed utilization rate exceeds 130%. The claimed transplant volume in this update does not make sense for the departments bed count: with such a high bed utilization rate, 50 kidney transplants per year would require only 3 beds; with 46 beds with occupancy as high as 130%, a conservative estimate using a 20-day hospitalization period would show that 46 beds can accommodate over 1,000 cases. (annual capacity of beds = 46 * 1.3 * 365/20 = 1091) The website of General Hospital of Jinan Military Command states that its urologic surgery department has completed 1,500 kidney transplants since 1978 and ranks among the top ten in China and the top five in the military.1> These two figures imply that the hospital has performed fewer than 200 kidney transplants per year since 2003. However, according to the Qilu Evening News in 2008, the department once performed 16 kidney transplants in 24 hours. In addition, transplantation.org.cn reported in 2012 that the department's director, Zhang Aimin, claimed that 317 the hospital had performed more than 2,500 kidney transplants between 1978 and 2012.16 The total on the hospitals website in 2016 is 1,000 fewer than Zhang Aimins figure from 2012. The News Centre of the website of the transplant centre at Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University stated in 2006 that \"Director Chen Guihua has served as lead surgeon for more than 1,000 liver transplants in recent years.\" 17After the release of the Matas/Kilgour report in 2006, Chen's personal webpage showed that he undertook only over 100 liver transplants. 1668 On the night of February 10, 2004, Chen oversaw 4 liver transplant operations simultaneously. He conducted 246 liver transplants in 2005, according to the hospitals News Centre. 16? In 2006, a Lifeweek report titled Medical Stories behind the Lens featured a segment regarding liver transplants at the Peoples Liberation Army No. 458 Hospital: 17On September 28, 2006, Dr. Sun Ningdong of the Peoples Liberation Army 458 Hospitals hepatobiliary surgery department hosted his first photography exhibition. Sun was most proud of one photo that had won many photography awards, Its Again the Dead of Night. That was a scene of the hospitals first liver transplant: At that time, this surgery had already lasted 6 hours at night. Some people were dozing off, and some were moving. If you magnify it, you can see the eyes of the lead surgeon- they are really bright. The 458 Hospital has now performed over 140 liver transplants... This report shows that in the two years after its first liver transplant in 2004, this hospital carried out more than 140 liver transplants. Twelve years later, however, its total number of liver transplants has not grown on paper. Photo: Its Again the Dead of Night If this were really the case, the hospital could not have Ascene of the Peoples Liberation Army maintained its certification by the Ministry of Health. The 458 Hospitals first liver transplant, Author: hospital also self-reported doing 20 liver transplantseach Dr. Sun Ningdong year (the minimum requirement to maintain its Ministry\napproval). Based on this number, by 2016 it should have performed nearly 400 liver transplants. Using a conservative figure of 70 cases per year from the media report, it would have accumulated nearly 1,000 liver transplants to date. Its liver disease centre has 108 beds and can simultaneously carry out two liver transplants and one regular surgery. Patient rooms are well-equipped with amenities, including five presidential suites with high-speed internet access.171 If we assume that each operating room is used only once per day (otherwise, only one operating room for liver 318 transplants would suffice), it would have performed 800 per year, or 10,000 to date. We estimate that the hospitals public numbers represent about 1/70 of its actual liver transplant volume. The website of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University indicates that its liver transplant centre has 28 formal beds and features highly mature surgical skill and perioperative treatment. Let alone, it's suspicious that such a large scale transplant centre has only 28 beds, it states that the centre had performed 23 total liver transplants of various types, as of May 2010.1672 According to the hospitals website, to manage the follow-up work of the centres large volume of liver transplant patients, the centres director Geng Xiaoping instructed associate chief physician Zhao Yijun to design and work with Hefei Hengtong Software Development Company to develop the Kangheng Medical Follow-Up Management System, which entered clinical use in April 2012 and was granted a national patent that November.!673 The official transplant figure implies that, in the 13 years after 1998, the centre performed an average of fewer than two liver transplants a year, a figure that far from justifies its bed count and custom-developed follow-up management software. Furthermore, a liver transplant conference the centre hosted in September 2011 was attended by more than 30 patients who had received liver transplants at this hospital.174 Rendering: The Organ Transplant Centre The introduction to the liver transplant centre of the West\nChina Hospital of Sichuan University published on September 2, 2004 mentioned that its five full sets of imported liver transplant equipment allowed five liver transplant operations to be performed simultaneously, and that the centre had 72 beds.!75 CCTV's People column broadcast a special interview with Yan Lvnan, whose team set a record of performing seven liver transplants on the same day. The webpage claimed that the centre had conducted nearly 800 liver transplants, including more than 260 from relative donors. Based on its bed count and a 30-day average hospitalization duration, the centre would be able to perform more than 800 transplants in a single year. The liver transplant centre no longer appears on the hospitals website.

HOSPITAL FUNDING Transition from Government Funding to Self-Reliance The shift from socialism to capitalism in China meant withdrawal of government funding from the health system. Before the change, the Government owned, funded and ran all hospitals. All physicians were state employees. With the transition to capitalism, this system was dismantled. From 1978 to 1999, the Beijing government's share of national health care spending fell from 32 percent to 15 percent. Between 1990 and 2002, public funding as a proportion of local public health revenues went from almost 60 percent to 42 percent. This led to privatization of most Chinese health care facilities. Hospitals were forced to rely on the sale of services to cover their expenses. David Blumenthal and William Hsiao wrote, \"Public hospitals came to function much like for-profit entities, focusing heavily on the bottom line.\"!727", "tokens": 191, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "According to cardiovascular doctor Hu Weimin, the state funding for the hospital where he worked was not enough to cover even staff salaries for one month. He stated, \"Under the current system, hospitals have to chase profit to survive.\" Human Rights in China reported, \"Rural hospitals [have had] to invent ways to make money to generate sufficient revenue.\" !728 The Government, in addition to withdrawing funding, imposed price controls on basic health services. These price controls were not comprehensive and left new technologies and drugs untouched. In addition, hospital doctor salaries were changed to include a bonus component based on hospital revenue. Blumenthal and Hsiao wrote, \"The result was an explosion in sales of expensive pharmaceuticals and high-tech services.\" All these changes drove hospitals to transplantsa new technology not covered by price controls, which provided private revenue and which, afterwards, required anti-rejection drugs. Transplant surgery became a leading method for hospitals in China to make money. For example, the Organ Transplant Center of the Armed Police General Hospital in Beijing boldly stated, \"Our Organ Transplant Center is our main department for making money. Its gross income in 2003 was 16,070,000 RMB. From January to June of 2004, income was 13,570,000 RMB.

A Japanese woman received a young girls liver with serial number 020014 and was charged $5 million USD.1752 In general, however, interviews with a group of international transplant recipients before 2006 reflected remarkably consistent prices:!73 In 2001, a group of 7 patients who went to China together for organ transplants were individually told to bring $200,000 HKD (about $26,000 USD) e In 2004, an Asian patient paid $27,000 USD for a kidney transplant at the Economic and Technical Development Hospital of Guangzhou In 2005, a patient from Taiwan paid $29,000 USD (including red envelope money, airline tickets, and other extras) for a kidney transplant at Guangdong Province Border Patrol Armed Police Central Hospital in Shenzhen\ne In 2006, a patient from Asia paid $26,000 USD in cash for a kidney transplant at the Land Force General Hospital of Wuhan e Other sources suggest the cost of a kidney transplant in China runs to $66,500 USD and a liver up to $157,000 USD1754 e Aheart transplant at the Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai can be had for $119,000 USD, a fraction of the $860,000 USD such an operation would cost in North America1755 Trends and Factors in Transplant Costs Different hospitals charge different fees for transplants but they tend to follow a common trend. From a few examples of the main players in Chinas organ transplant industry, we can see a decline in medical and pharmaceutical costs coinciding with an overall increase transplant fees. The main factors driving transplant costs are the treatment itself (including surgery and hospitalization costs), pharmaceuticals (including the ongoing regimen of anti-rejection drugs), and the donor organ source. Between 1995 and 1999, Wuhan Tongji Hospital charged an average of 300,000 to 400,000 RMB anda maximum of 800,000 RMB. In August 2001, surgery fees decreased significantly to around 150,000 RMB on average (the range was 110,000 to 190,000 RMB). The director of the hospitals organ transplant research institute stated that the decrease in costs were due to the maturation of technology, decrease in operation times from 7-10 hours to 4-5 hours, reduced bleeding, lower cost of blood transfusions, shorter anesthesia times, fewer postoperative complications, and shorter hospitalization times. By 2002, Tongji Hospital had reduced its liver transplant operation time to 4 hours and the cost to below 150,000 RMB, the lowest in the country. 1756 333 As we observe, at the early stage after 2000, transplant prices steadily declined due to technological\ndevelopment and abundant organ sources. The dramatic decline of surgery costs and treatments made it affordable for a wider range of patients. The maturation of technology and increase in both domestic and international patients led to an exceptional growth in China's organ transplant industry. The decrease in medical costs due to improvements in technology and techniques is also reflected at Shanghai General Hospital, which in 2002 eliminated the need for blood transfusions in one-third of its liver transplant surgeries. The entire operation time was reduced to four and a half hours, and the lowest cost was 142,000 RMB.1757 A 2003 investigation of liver transplant costs showed that early-stage recipients had an average pharmaceutical cost of 198,000 RMB every six months after surgery. The same cost for late-stage patients was more than 230,000 RMB. Recipients also need anti-rejection drugs, which cost more than 30,000 RMB per year.1758 As of 2003, the surgery fee at Jiangsu Provincial Peoples Hospital was one-tenth to one-eighth that of the Same surgery in other countries.!79 In 2004, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital's hepatobiliary department director Ding Yitao told a reporter that the hospitals liver transplant fee averaged 150,000 RMB, the lowest in the country. Postoperative anti-rejection drugs cost around 3,000 RMB per month for domestically produced products and 5,000 RMB for imported drugs.1760 In the same year, the Peoples Liberation Army No. 309 Hospital charged 200,000 RMB for liver transplants and 300 RMB per day for anti-rejection drugs.!6! Early in the same year, the Oriental Organ Transplant Center charged around $32,000 USD (~250,000 RMB) for liver transplants. By 2006, the fee had increased to 400,000 RMB for international patients but remained at around 200,000 RMB for domestic patients.1!76\nSince international patients are charged much more than domestic patients, organ tourism became a factor in driving up transplant prices. After the organ harvesting crimes were revealed in 2006, transplant prices generally stabilized due to the shrinking international market. In recent years, along with the resurgence of the international market, both international and domestic demand have increased. According to a report by Jingchu Network in August 2015,!763 liver transplants in China cost around 600,000 RMB, and kidney transplants cost around 300,000 RMB. From these descriptions of costs for liver and kidney transplants from different channels, we can see that the fees in the past few years have been significantly higher than those before 2006.", "tokens": 1389, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "However, medical and pharmaceutical costs have trended downward. Thus, organ sources may be representing an increasingly large portion of transplant fees and one may naturally wonder if the increase in fees is due to a shortage in the organ supply. While he is hardly a reliable source it is interesting that Huang Jiefu threw cold water on that notion, stating in the same year that the limiting factors of organ transplantation in China lie primarily in medical costs and availability of transplant hospitals and doctors: Only the third [reason] is that there are not that many donor bodies; even though donor bodies are abundant right now, there aren't that many hospitals and that many doctors that can [perform transplants].1764 Nevertheless, compared to the number of patients waiting for transplants, the transplant capacity of hospitals and organs available are still scarce resources. Despite an endless line of domestic patients in need of transplants, the profit-maximizing strategy for hospitals is to provide transplants to those most willing and 334 able to pay. This can be seen in Huang Jiefus push to establish a platform to provide organ sources to Taiwan. Furthermore, we see international patients being charged more than domestic patients, to the tune of hundreds of thousands or even millions of USD-fees that are many times the treatment and pharmaceutical costs involved. This scheme takes advantage of the extremely inelastic nature of the market, given that these patients from other countries would otherwise have to wait years for a transplant.

In other words, it takes between 20 and 100 sources to find tissue type compatibility with a recipient; while media reports in China indicate a kidney tissue type matching percentage of between 20% and 30%.176 Immunosuppressant drugs can lessen rejection responses from tissue type incompatibility. Globally, sources and patients with six out of ten matching points are considered tissue-type compatible. The number of matching points has a direct impact on the rejection rate and the amount of immunosuppressants needed. In China, however, 4 matching points, or sometimes even fewer, are acceptable.

Since the advent of the persecution campaign against Falun Gong, the Government of China has continuously incorporated organ transplantation into its Five-Year Plans for multiple ministriesa rare occurrence. 337 In 2001, establishing organ transplantation regulations was listed as part of the Tenth Five-Year Plan for the Ministry of Health.1773 In 2004, organ transplantation technology was added as a major research area and key technology in the Tenth Five-Year Plan for National Health, Science and Technology Development of the Peoples Republic of China.!774 In 2008, organ transplantation was included once again as a Key project in the Eleventh Five-Year National Key Technology Research and Development Program.!77 Since 2011, organ transplantation has been included again in the Twelfth Five-Year National Key Technology Research and Development Program and a number of other national special plans within that Twelfth Five-Year Plan,.1776 1777 Chinas National Program on Key Basic Research Projects (973 Program) is a foundational research and major development project guided by national strategic demands. It is meant to be progressive, advanced, comprehensive, and to assume a leading role in China's future development and advancement in scientific technology. Its orientation is to support significant scientific research.!778 The High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) aims to address high-tech issues of national long-term development and national security; it is meant to be strategic, cutting-edge, and forward-looking.

The military, central and local governments have invested heavily in domestic medical institutions to carry out basic research and development in the organ transplant field and promote its industrialization. These Strategies are illustrated by the following examples: The largest transplant center in Asia is located in Tianjin. The director of the Oriental Organ Transplant Center of Tianjin First Hospital, Shen Zhongyang (also director of the Institute of Organ Transplantation of the Chinese People's Armed Police General Hospital), was named the \"father of Chinese liver transplantation.\" He was appointed as the chief expert of the organ transplant program under the national 863 Program and an expert in biological and medical technology under the same program. !789 He claimed that organ transplantation is gospel in medicine and will change the world, that China has 130 million Hepatitis B carriers whose conditions are irreversible, and that the only solution is liver transplantation. The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University has the largest transplant center in eastern China. The hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery center and its affiliated liver transplant center have a team of 134 medical professionals, including Zhen Shusen, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and nearly 40 senior transplant experts.

It invested 8 million RMB in five hospitals to conduct clinical research in heart, liver, and lung transplants. These five hospitals include Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Ruijin Hospital and Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital of the Second Military Medical University, Shanghai First Peoples Hospital, and Shanghai Lung Hospital. In 2003, the total number of organ transplants in Shanghai was more than 10 times that of 2001, and the hospitals achieved a few \"national and even international first\" titles in organ transplantation.!784 People's Daily Online reported in June 2014 that Renji Hospital's liver transplant center at Shanghai Jiaotong University has become a key clinical specialization of a number of science and health programs under the National Health and Family Planning Commission, National \"Project 211,\" National Clinical Pharmacology Institute of Organ Transplantation, and the most important clinical key discipline of the Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission. In recent years, the center received funding for seven projects by the National Natural Science Foundation of China; one project supported by the National Health and Family Planning Commission, a joint research project on major diseases supported by the Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission, more than ten general programs, and key programs supported by the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission. The total research funding amounted to over 20 million RMB.1785 We list here a few more organ transplant centers which have embarked on vast projects in recent years and their projects:\nDou Kefeng, the director of the Peoples Liberation Army Institute of Organ Transplantation of Xijing Hospital, Affiliated to the Fourth Military Medical University, has taken the lead in the following projects: two sub-projects of national \"863 Program\", one project in \"Eleventh Five-Year National Key Technology Research and Development Program, one major project and three projects in the National Natural Science Foundation, one military clinical high-tech major project, the military \"Eleventh five-Year scientific and technological research disciplines, three military \"2110\" projects, and a special military discipline.

In recent five years, this institute has published 410 papers, including 78 SCI papers and 11 books.1789\nIn addition, other prestigious universities and affiliated hospitals, as well as almost all military and civilian medical universities and their affiliated hospitals, are rapidly developing their organ transplant research and receiving a large amount of national funding. These institutions include Tsinghua University, Peking University, Renmin University, Shanghai Tongji University, Wuhan University, Central South University, Jilin University, and Lanzhou University, etc. These examples reflect that the Chinese Government has made organ transplantation a high priority in its national strategy, and have been stimulating and driving its development. Involvement of Party Officials in Developing Transplant Hospitals Many Communist Party and government officials at all levels have supported the hospitals transplant activities, by helping to remove the obstacles of development, providing financial aid, or playing a matchmaking role in establishing collaborative relationships between transplant centers. We give a few cases below as examples. Vice Chairman of Standing Committee of National People's Congress Guides Establishment of Peking University Organ Transplant Center In October 2001, the Peking University Organ Transplant Center was established under the guidance of Han Qide, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.!7\" It incorporated related departments from five medical institutions, including Peking University First Hospital, Peking University Peoples Hospital, and Peking University Third Hospital. The center specializes in transplantation of liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, cornea, bone marrow, and other organs. It claims to be the largest and most academically advanced in China, with its liver transplant capabilities in a leading position in the Beijing region. 1791 The Peking University Organ Transplant Center was the predecessor of the Peking University 340 Organ Transplantation Research Institute. In 2013, Zhu Jiye, director of the Institute, revealed to the media that it conducted 4,000 liver and kidney transplants within a particular year. 1792 Jiangxi Provincial Party Secretary Assists Transplantation at Nanchang University\nThe First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University is the only hospital in Jiangxi Province with an independent organ transplant center. It is also the best equipped in the province. In 1991, this hospital became the first in the province to perform kidney transplants, followed by heart, liver, combined liver- kidney, combined pancreas-kidney, bone marrow, and cornea transplants. Within the first four months since its official opening, the center was able to perform 6 vital-organ transplants in one day.!7% Meng Jianzhu, former Jiangxi Provincial Party Secretary and current Party Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Political and Legal Affairs Committee, has historically supported this hospitals transplantation activity. He personally played a matchmaking role in establishing a collaborative relationship between this hospital and the Shanghai Organ Transplant Center (Shanghai General Hospital).!794 Promotion of Organ Transplantation by Hubei Provincial Party Secretary Since December 2007, Li Hongzhong has sequentially held the roles of governor of Hubei Province and provincial Party Secretary. On February 25, 2014, he attended the 2013 Hubei Province Science and Technology Awards Conference held in Wuhan. He gave Tongji Hospital a special award for scientific and technological progress for its research program in new technology for combined transplants and treatment of major diseases. Since then, these capabilities have been propagated to organ transplant centers at ten 3A hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other regions. 179 Prior to the above, Li Xiansheng, the Deputy Party Secretary of Wuhan and mayor of Wuhan between April 2002 and December 2007, enthusiastically supported and promoted the citys development in organ transplantation. In mid-November 2003, after listening to a report by the citys science and technology bureau, he raised the need to advance the citys transplantation technical base and facilities.17%6\nAccording to a Sina Global News report dated in November 2011, Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, is said to be Chinas largest organ transplant center. Among its hospitals, Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science & Technology is the best known; it is also one of Chinas first and most authoritative hospitals for living kidney transplants. It conducts thousands of kidney transplants each year and has Chinas largest pool of kidney recipients.1797 Organ transplantation in Shenzhen grew extremely quickly between June 2003 and November 2007, when Li Hongzhong was the citys mayor and Party Secretary. In July 2006, authorities in Shenzhen became the first in the country to add heart and liver transplants to local subsidized health insurance programs. This reflects the speed at which the organ transplant industry developed in Shenzhen. ' Industrialization of Organ Transplantation Organ transplantation in China began when Wu Jieping, a member of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering, completed the country's first kidney transplant in March 1960.!799 Kidney transplantation experiments were expanded nationwide in the 1970s. Since 1990, more than 1,000 kidney 341 transplants were being performed each year. By the late 1990s, around 80 kidney transplant facilities had been opened nationwide, each averaging less than 20 annual operations. According to Zheng Shusen in March 2006, liver transplantation in China went through three stages of development.!8 The 1970s was a period of experimental and clinical exploration: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan and Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai first carried out clinical liver transplants in 1977. Liver transplantation soon peaked before declining and coming to a standstill in the mid-to-late 1980s. It rose to 78 cases between 1990 and 1998, reaching 16 in 1997 and 27 in 1998.", "tokens": 1510, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The volume then jumped to 115 cases in 1999 before surging.", "tokens": 11, "label": "light"}
{"text": "Each facility has also gradually matured in its clinical experience. Since 2000, a large number of national and military transplantation medical technology research centers and key research laboratories have been established, incubated new transplant technologies, and led the rapid development of the transplant industry. After nearly 40 years of preparation and then relying on a living organ bank, transplantation in China saw a unique explosive growth from sporadic cases to the large-scale transplant industry it has now. Case Study: Establishing Industry Standards and Routine Procedures Shen Zhongyang, the director of both Tianjin Oriental Organ Transplant Center and the Liver Transplant Institute of the Armed Police General Hospital, is known as the founder of Chinas modern clinical liver transplantation. He is the first in China to establish a multidisciplinary liver transplant standard and procedures. With surgery as the central link, he standardized a process for liver transplantation with multidisciplinary collaboration. As a result, liver transplants have become part of routine clinical practice in China. According to the 2009 edition of the Tianjin Medical Journal, between January 2004 and August 2008, Shen participated in 1,600 liver graft procurements.!8! The now-standard procedure for excising the liver from a donor lowered the time necessary for the organ to remain at body temperature to under five minutes and reduced the time for procurement operations to thirty minutes.1802\nShen pioneered and improved a variety of liver transplant surgical procedures. He developed an integrated prevention system that reduced the recurrence rate of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplants from over 80% to under 5%,1893 This advancement resolved a major obstacle in liver transplantation in China. He wrote books including Clinical Liver Transplantation, Modern Clinical Liver Transplantation, China Liver Transplantation, and Liver Transplantation Manual to address continuously emerging theories and technologies. He helped 66 medical facilities in 22 regions to carry out clinical liver transplants, training 200 transplant professional personal and spreading the \"pinnacle of transplantation technology.\" In July 2006, the center was sponsored by the China Medical Board (CMB, a private foundation based in the U.S.) and became a National Liver Transplant Training Center. It has trained 385 doctors, who have become the backbone of organ transplant departments in other hospitals, where huge numbers of transplants are performed on the front lines. 342 Case Study: From Research to Industrialization The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University is a national research base in central and southern China for transplantation technologies on organ, tissue and cellular levels. The hospital has the capacity to conduct major organ transplants on a large scale and now leads the country in the total number of solid organ transplants performed, including liver, kidney, combined liver-kidney, combined heart-lung, and intestinal transplants.1804 1805 In August 2001, the hospital invested nearly one billion RMB to build the Hunan Transplant Medical Center, including laboratories, laminar flow operating rooms, an ICU ward, and 150 transplantation beds.18% In 2005, the Transplant Medicine Engineering and Technology Research Center affiliated with the Ministry of Health was officially established in this hospital. Its mission was to build an important national base specializing in clinical transplantation medical research and related industry development. The center also collaborated with the World Health Organization and the International Xenotransplantation Association to develop xenograft international norms (the Changsha Standard). 1807\nThe center received funding from the National Natural Science Foundation and other key projects in clinical disciplines from the Ministry of Health.", "tokens": 566, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The hospital also concentrated manpower, material, and financial resources to industrialize related research results. The center has carried out liver, kidney, small intestine, spleen, heart, nerve, ovarian, testicular, and multi- organ transplantation. Its clinical work includes transplantation of islet cells, bone tissue, bone marrow, stem cells, liver cells, and spleen cells. The center also cooperated with the Human Disease Genes Research Center of Peking University under the national 863 Programs Human Genome Study to research immunosuppressant drugs, pharmacogenomics, and its personalized medicine.18 The hospital experienced tremendous growth. Its new 1,000-bed, 98-metre-tall surgery building became operational on April 9, 2008 and represented 600 million RMB in investment.18 Spread of Organ Transplantation The Ministry of Health guides some military and civilian medical institutions with strong technical capability, as well as large organ transplant centers, to conduct clinical teaching and practice, establish technical training bases for transplantation, and promote new transplantation technologies. A large number of transplant doctors have been trained in a short time to meet the rapid growth of Chinas transplant industry. Case Studies Mobile Heart Transplant Hospital Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen Universitys Heart Center was established in 2001 and began to operate independently on April 28, 2011.181 In 2014, it became the Xiamen Cardiovascular Hospital. Its new site has 600 beds.1811 343 Liao Chongxian, the founder of the heart center, has been named Chinas top person in heart transplantation. 1812 On August 21, 1995, he performed the first heart transplant in Fujian Province and the first pediatric heart transplant and first heart-kidney transplant in China. Based on his experience in the United States, Liao created the mobile heart transplant hospital model and travelled around the country to instruct and personally participate in heart transplants. 1813\nIn 2001, he established the Xiamen Heart Center Cardiovascular Surgery Department at Zhongshan Hospital and started his mobile heart transplant hospital model.!814 Its website says that the department performs heart transplants on a large scale and has helped more than 20 Class 3 Grade A hospitals to perform heart transplants in the past 10 years. Liao revealed to the media that as of 2004, more than 75 heart transplant recipients had received their transplants from his hospital. 1815 A New Era of Lung Transplants The lung transplant center at Wuxi Peoples Hospital claims to be among the top three in the world,!! and claims to have completed more than half of all lung transplant surgeries in the country.!8! Its founder, Chen Jingyu, is thus renowned as the No. 1 Lung Transplant Surgeon in China. As reported in July 2014, Chens team often completed four or five lung transplants a day. He led his team to spread its advanced techniques to more than thirty 3A hospitals in more than ten cities and provinces, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Jilin.1818 A new era of lung transplantation in China has begun, and Chens team has filled in many gaps in this area.1819 Spreading Advances in Liver Transplantation Zheng Shusen served as the academic lead of the transplant center at the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University. He was one of the pioneers of liver and multi-organ transplantation. The hospital has helped develop transplantation at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, and other institutions. It has also established remote diagnostic systems with the First Hospital of Zhejiang Province and other hospitals in Zhejiang, Fujian, Guizhou, Xinjiang, and other areas. Its transplant capabilities radiate to more than 20 provinces and cities in China and have propelled the development of the countrys organ transplant industry. Zheng was among the first in China to use a non-venous bypass technique to reduce bleeding, transfusions, surgery time, ICU time, and cost. His award-winning innovations in liver and multi-organ transplants have been put into use all over the country.182 344 Building a Remote Medical Network Through Military Satellites No. 181 Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command serves as the organ transplant center for Guangzhou Military Command. It has a number of Peoples Liberation Army medical centers, clinical bases, research institutes, and key specialties under the Guangzhou Military Command. In early 2005, it spent 250,000 RMB to build a remote medical network through military satellites, connecting over 200 military hospitals and more than 1,000 experts. This remote treatment model provides patients with a platform for accessing high-end medical resources.1821 Its Peoples Liberation Army Kidney Transplant Center performed 8 transplant surgeries on December 30, 2012, including heart, lung, kidney, liver, cornea, and islet cell transplants. Although this hospital is not qualified to conduct heart transplants, conducted experiments and clinical research in heart transplantation using a partially continuous beating technique, a technique that is internationally advanced and has been applied in other hospitals.1822 Sharing Organ Sources and Technical Support\nOn August 12, 2003, the Xiamen Evening News published a report titled New Breakthrough at Xiamen First Hospital: Two Liver Transplants in One Day: In the morning of August 12, the hospital simultaneously completed liver transplants for two patients. Li Bin, director of the vascular hepatopancreatobiliary surgery department, revealed that if there are sufficient organ sources and recipients, they can perform three liver transplants in one day. However, the fact that the First Xiamen hospitals newly detached vascular hepatobiliary surgery department can perform three liver transplants per day was beyond ones expectation. How had they achieved that? The hospital obtained two donors at the same time from the largest organ transplant center in eastern China-the affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University. It also received technical support from academician Zheng Shusen. According to the report, the department had reached an organ sourcing and technology sharing agreement with the affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University. The affiliated Zhejiang hospital has a nationwide system of organ sources and basic research in key laboratories, both of which could be borrowed by the First Xiamen hospital.1823 The First Peoples Hospital of Yueyang collaborated with Tongji Hospital and many other hospitals to provide remote consultation for patients with complicated diseases. Meanwhile, the hospital has set up an organ information sharing network with many hospitals inside and outside the province, enabling the sharing of organ resources and complementing of transplant capabilities. 1824 Similarly, Rui Jin Hospital in Shanghai has equipped its transplantation pathology laboratory with a remote consultation system connected to the University of Pittsburgh Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute, enhancing the diagnosis of difficult cases.1825 The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University collaborated with the Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic (HPB) Surgery Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Medical University to conduct remote medical consultation. It established a communication platform with University of Heidelberg in Germany to further develop the discipline.1826 345\nA media report in 2005 stated that the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South Universitys \"...donor organ network has gradually extended to the north and south, and has established resource sharing relationships with more than 10 domestic organ transplant centers. 1827 Training Transplant Specialists to Keep Up with Demand We found that many leading institutions have been selected by the Ministry of Health to train a large number of transplant specialists for hospitals nationwide, allowing the industrys work force to better keep up with demand. In June 2006, Huang Jiefu cooperated with the China Medical Board (CMB) in New York to provide one million USD to assist in the establishment of transplant standard and registration systems, domestic laws and regulations regarding transplantation in China, strengthening professional training, and expanding liver transplant-related research achievements. The project established three liver transplant training centers in China, at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, and Tianjin First Center Hospital.!28 Two doctors from the Department of Kidney Transplantation at Nanfang Hospital of Guangzhou's First Military Medical University wrote in a published paper, Experience of Guiding Graduate Internship in renal transplant clinical work, in November 2003: \"With the growing number of kidney transplants in recent years, our department attracted many young military and civilian medical students attending Master's and Doctoral programs in renal transplantation. These intern students stayed with our department for 6 to 8 months ... Donor nephrectomy technique is an important part of kidney transplantation ... the requirement is to minimize warm ischemia time, to avoid damage during excision in complicated environments...Graduate students increasingly participated in nephrectomies under the guidance of teachers ... from initially inexperienced in renal transplant to the end of the internship, these students became more skilled specialists in renal transplantation. Most graduates are assigned to various work units after training, where they become the backbone of their renal transplantation teams.\"1829 On these hospitals websites, a large number of young \"associate experts claim to have \"skilled donor organ excision techniques and rich experience in handling donor organs. The Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery at Southwest Hospital, which is affiliated with the Third Military Medical University, was the first major liver transplant laboratory and transplant center in the military. With world-class equipment and many functional laboratories, it is one of the largest hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery departments, both domestically and internationally. It guided 21 medical institutions to carry out liver transplants in Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Henan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Fujian provinces, etc. It has graduated 50 PhD students, 75 Masters students, and 762 internship doctors in the major of Hepatopancreaticobiliary Surgery. These graduates have become the backbone and academic leaders in their facilities all over the country and in the military. '* The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University has a multi-organ transplantation research laboratory under the Ministry of Health. It claims to be the largest transplant center in the east of China and one of largest transplant centers in the whole country. It assisted Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, and other domestic and international hospitals in carrying out liver transplants, and extending technical support to more than 20 provinces and cities nationwide.!831 346 The organ transplantation center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University claimed to offer the most variety of transplants nationwide and is among the top in transplant volume.!832 The hospital performed China's first successful kidney transplant in 1972. Since Huang Jiefu in 1993 successfully implemented China's first liver transplant in vitro blood bypass, the hospital is known as the birthplace of the second peak in China's liver transplantation. In 2006, this center was approved by the Ministry of Health as a national kidney transplant technical training base. It has also become one of the three largest liver transplantation training centers sponsored by the China Medical Board (a private foundation based in the U.S.). \"The Institute of Organ Transplantation Research at Xi'an Jiaotong University is one of the largest transplant centers in the country and includes all functions of medicine, teaching, and research. Its researchers include 9 professors in their doctoral program, and has trained 85 PhD graduates, and 156 Master's degree holders.\" 1833 In 2003, it incorporated with Terasaki laboratory of the United States and jointly established the Organ Transplants Tissue Typing Technology Training Center in Northwest China. By December 2012, this center had guided more than 10,000 kidney transplants for 23 hospitals in 13 provinces. It guided other hospitals in liver, kidney, heart, lung, and small intestine transplants in western China./8** It trained more than 500 medical professionals for other domestic institutions, with some of them having become academic leaders. Since 2000, this center has held annual programs for continued education in kidney transplantation, with students from large general hospitals from 14 provinces and autonomous regions. \"After learning from this program, the students started or carried out a greater number of high quality clinical kidney transplants and achieved a remarkable degree of continuing medical education. 347 IV. KEY TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Unccessful research and trials that proved the feasibility of transplant technology were followed by a nationwide effort to make the technology readily accessible throughout China. In the past decade, these hospitals and individuals have achieved many innovations that enabled the growth of the transplant industry and made it possible to achieve its present-day scale. These achievements include lower rejection rates, shortened operation times, increased collaboration, and other advances. Reducing Rejection Responses Case Study: \"Father of Chinese Hepatobiliary Surgery\" Awarded 1 Million RMB\nAccording to Chinese state media, former president Jiang Zemin has met Wu Mengchao, \"the father of Chinese hepatobiliary surgery,\" four times. 1835 Wu is the president of the Eastern Hepatobiliary Hospital of the Second Military Medical University and the chief advisor of the Peoples Liberation Army Organ Transplant Conference. At a special ceremony held by the Central Military Commission, Jiang personally conferred upon Wu the honor of \"Leading Model Medical Expert\" and awarded him a First-Class Heroes Medal. In 2005, Wu Mengchao was given the 2005 Annual National Supreme Science and Technology Award for solving several key issues surrounding rejection of liver transplants.!83 On January 17, 2006, Sun Dafa, political commissar of the Peoples Liberation Army General Logistics Department, awarded Wu a prize of 1 million RMB.1837 As of 2010, among his 14,000+ liver surgeries, Wu had performed at least 9,300 tumor removals,!838 while the remaining 4,000+ were unaccounted for and likely to be transplant cases. As of April 2011, even at the age of 89, he continued to perform 200 surgeries per year. 1839 On October 10, 2011, the Central Propaganda Ministry, the Ministry of Health, the General Political Department, the Peoples Liberation Army General Logistics Department, and the Shanghai Municipal Committee jointly held a report session on \"Wu Mengchaos chronology of achievements\" in the Great Hall of the People. Those in attendance included Xu Caihou (former Vice Chairman of Chinese Communist Party Central Military Commission), Li Jinai (then-director of the General Political Department), and Liao Xilong (director of Peoples Liberation Army General Logistics Department).1840 Case Study: Leading Research at Peoples Liberation Army No.", "tokens": 2322, "label": "heavy"}

It has become an important method of diagnosing acute rejection 348 responses and established a low-dosage inmunosuppressive system and a method integrating Chinese medicine to prevent and treat rejection responses.1841 When interviewed by Xinhua in February 2012, Shi Bingyi said that the most important issue concerning transplants is preserving the organs function and long-term survival. He explained, \"There are two ways: one is a stem cell transplant; another is to improve the regulation of the immune system, such as T cells.", "tokens": 117, "label": "light"}
{"text": "The latter has a good effect on the long-term survival of transplanted organs and immune tolerance.", "tokens": 16, "label": "light"}
{"text": "This is one of world's leading technological research topics that we're carrying on in our center. 1842 Many other transplant hospitals have also explored this field. Beijing Anzhen Hospital performed the worlds first four combined heart, bone marrow, and stem cell transplants as an innovation in the knowledge and techniques of improving immune tolerance. Heart recipients experienced lower rejection rates while maintaining resistance against viruses and bacteria. Thus, lesser quantities of immunological drugs were needed. This result can potentially be extended to the fields of lung and other actual organ transplants.1843 The kidney transplant department at the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine combines traditional Chinese and Western treatment methods to minimize the incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy to a large extent. Its advanced follow-up system improves long-term graft survival.1844 Fujian Medical University Union Hospital has recently made breakthroughs in immunosuppressive treatments and post-operative management. Its heart transplant recipients are able to walk within one to two days after surgery, leave the isolation ward after two weeks, and be discharged within two to three weeks, fully recovered. 18 [mmunosuppressants\nWith the rapid development of organ transplantation, Chinas market in immunosuppressants has seen unprecedented growth. Our investigation of the over 160 transplant hospitals showed that the Government has incorporated organ transplantation into its national strategy. Below are examples of national programs that fund key research and development projects in transplantation technology and immunosuppressants: National High-Tech R&D Program of China (863 Program) National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China (973 Program) National Key Technology Research and Development Program National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) e 985 Project (aims to build world-class universities) e 211 Project (aims to raise the research standards of 100 high-level universities) These programs and funded projects have achieved fruitful results.

By 2004, domestic drugs began to catch up and shared almost half of the market with imported and joint-stock drugs. This development greatly lowered the cost of immunosuppressants and lifted a barrier for many patients who 350 otherwise could not afford to receive organ transplants. It thereby contributed to a rapid growth in transplant volume in China before 2004. 1853\nThe first domestic immunosuppressant was Ciclosporin made by the North China Pharmaceutical Group. In 2004, Professor Zhang Yuhai, director of the Urology Department of the Beijing Friendship Hospital, said that over half of kidney transplant patients chose to use domestic immunosuppressants, including not only self- funded patients but also many with free medical service or insurance.1854 Figure 9.4. A plant for producing immunosuppressants The 2011 China Science and Technology Development Report published by the Ministry of Science and Technology claimed in its section on the prevention of major diseases and practical health technology that the completion of a pilot production demonstration base for a series of immunosuppressive drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients and preparations. It said that this has improved China's research, development, and production capacity for immunosuppressive drugs. Domestically produced immunosuppressants reduce medical costs for transplant recipients and are exported to bring profit and enhance international competitiveness for Chinas transplant immunosuppressant industry.185 According to data from the Southern Medical Economic Institute, domestic immunosuppressants had grown into a $10 billion RMB market by 2006.185 The market grew by an average of 13% every year between 2008 and 2014.1857 As the patents of several major imported drugs expired, China began to produce a large volume of imitation products in addition to domestically developed drugs.

{"text": "Hl. A TRANSPLANT VOLUME SCENARIO BASED ON MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS We first look at the total transplant volume performed by the 712 liver and kidney transplant hospitals using the minimum requirements for permitted transplant centers from authorities of all levels. 146 Ministry-Approved Hospitals For hospitals approved to perform liver and/or kidney transplants by the Ministry of Health, we calculate their minimum transplant capacity using the Ministrys minimum bed requirements to maintain certification. 356\nOn June 27, 2006, the Ministry of Health published a Notice Regarding the Management and Regulation of Liver, Kidney, Heart, and Lung Transplantation Capabilities, which imposed the following requirements for medical institutions carrying out organ transplants:1877 e liver: 15 beds dedicated to liver transplants and no fewer than 10 ICU beds kidney: 20 beds dedicated to kidney transplants and no fewer than 10 ICU beds For the 146 hospitals with kidney and/or liver transplant permits (national-level civilian and military transplant centres and designated transplant centres), the minimum bed counts are as follows: Table 10.1: Minimum transplant bed count requirements by the Ministry of Health. Based on a one-month hospitalization period, each bed can accommodate up to 12 transplant patients per year. In practice, kidney transplants generally require one to two weeks, and liver transplants take three to four weeks. Since we are mixing kidney and liver transplants in our volume analysis, we use the maximum hospitalization duration as our average. Our survey of 165 hospitals indicate widespread facility constraints, including transplant centers that exceed 100% bed utilization and have a long line of patients waiting for transplants. It may also be germane that Huang Jiefus plan to expand the number of approved transplant hospitals from 169 to 300 suggests that the current system-wide capacity cannot keep up with demand. 1878 1879 Thus, we assume that the vast majority of existing capacity has been utilized to perform transplants. Assuming 100% bed utilization, our calculations indicate that these 146 hospitals combined could theoretically conduct 69,300 transplants per year. In China, liver transplants gradually became a routine clinical procedure after 2000, 188 shortly after kidney transplants also began to be carried out on a large scale. By then, a few kidney transplant centers had already exceeded 1,000 kidney transplants. Since many liver transplant centers also conduct kidney transplants, their lead in conducting kidney transplants compensates for the relative delay in scaling up liver transplants. We thus multiply annual figures by 15 years for approved hospitals, excluding the year of 2000 as ramp-up time. Following this method, the total number of transplants performed over 15 years is 1,039,500 total transplants. 357 Table 10.2: A volume scenario of 146 hospitals permitted to conduct transplants, based on transplant bed count requirements by the Ministry of Health. 351,00 0 594,00 Liver & se 39,600 sm Total 1,039,500 566 Non-Approved Hospitals Because only 164 of the more than 1,000 hospitals who applied under the Ministry of Healths 2007 approval system received permits, in reality there are more than 566 non-approved hospitals performing transplants. Despite not being approved by the Ministry of Health, many of these facilities have not halted their transplant activities and some of these non-approved institutions had significant transplant volumes. Compared to the Ministry-approved hospitals, these institutions have more flexibility to obtain living organ sources through various channels and to continue organ harvesting. In addition, several dozen non-approved military and armed police hospitals face no restrictions and are performing organ transplants as usual, because they control abundant supplies of live organ sources. They are not regulated by the Ministry of Health or local governments; the military has designated Peoples Liberation Army organ transplant centers at many of these hospitals. 405 Large-Scale Non-Approved Military and Civilian Hospitals All these 3A institutions are located in large cities with over 500 inpatient beds. There are cases of centres in medium-sized cities performing 100 transplants in three months, 188! which would translate to 400 per year assuming a constant rate. All 405 hospitals in this category are 3A hospitals with larger capacities and greater demand. There could be great variations in transplant volume from hospital to hospital, we set the baseline for each large-scale hospital at 100 transplants per year. 161 Medium-Size and Alternative Non-Approved Transplant Hospitals\nThe group includes 161 medium-size transplant institutions, 55 Class 3 Grade B hospitals, 106 Class 2 hospitals, and a few smaller ones that also conduct organ transplants. These hospitals usually perform more kidney transplants, which have lower technical requirements than liver transplants do. Many of these hospitals have performed far more transplants than the minimum volume, with some performing hundreds per year. Before the Ministry of Health released its list of 164 approved transplant centers in 2007, transplant centers across China had been qualified for transplantation by various assessment departments. For example, the minimum requirement for a qualified kidney transplant center in Guangdong Province in 2003 was to conduct at least 50 358 kidney transplants per year.!882 Between September and December 2003, 30 hospitals qualified for kidney transplants and 17 for liver transplants. We assume 50 transplants per year for each medium non-approved transplant center. Sum of 566 Non-Approved Hospitals Since the military controls ample organ sources, its transplant centers have been almost unaffected by the introduction of transplant permits in 2007 and have continued to carry out transplants. Many non-approved civilian centers also continued to conduct transplants after 2007, but their individual situations varied; we assume that all non-approved hospitals stopped performing transplants after 2007 and therefore we multiply the annual volumes for non-approved hospitals by 7 years, ending in 2007. In total, non-approved transplant centers can perform up to 48,550 transplants per year. Over a period of 7 years, the total comes to 339,850 transplants. Table 10.3: Estimated annual transplant volume of non-approved hospitals based on minimum requirements. Number of Annual Annual Hospital Type Hospitals Transplants Transplants of All Years Total Per Hospital Hospitals\nLarge Non-Permitted 405 100 40,500 283,500 Medium Non-Permitted 161 8,050 56,350 Sum of 712 Hospitals Based on Minimum Requirements Adding the 1,039,500 transplants by approved hospitals and 339,850 by non-approved hospitals yields 1,379,350, approximately 1.4 million transplants, which translates into about 90,000 transplants a year. Table 10.4: A transplant volume scenario based on Ministry of Health requirements for permitted hospitals and local regulations for non-permitted hospitals. Hospital Type Number of Hospitals Total ~ 1.4 million (~ 90,000 annual) 359 This analysis is based on the published minimum bed counts under the Ministry of Healths permit system in 2007. Even though the Ministry approved only 164 centers, most of which carry out far more transplants than the minimum bed counts can produce, it is relevant that more than 1,000 hospitals applied for permits to conduct transplants under this system logically implies that they also met these minimum requirements or were close to meeting them.!883 The reported transplant figures indicate that the total number of transplants performed before 2007 by the 80% of hospitals that have not received permits are comparable to that of the approved 20%. IV. BACK-OF-THE-ENVELOPE VOLUME SCENARIOS Throughout this report we have tried to avoid selectively using Chinese state claims. We did not inspect these hospitals to make sure that they have the minimum number of beds for transplant patients. Presumably the Ministry of Health did that. Yet it is difficult to verify the Ministry of Healths approval process. It could be plagued with corruption. Many state approval processes throughout China are. So it is legitimate for the skeptical reader not to assume that an approach which uses minimum requirements set by the state to count transplants will be perfectly accurate. The skeptical reader is entitled to ask us to wipe the slate clean and, assuming that they have been following the text this far, to come up with a simple estimate which can plausibly capture a low scenario within the bounds of common sense. Yet the cumulative effect of the evidence presented here is not merely numerical. Clearly the Chinese transplant system is highly competitive, state-sponsored, and much more productive than was previously understood. In short, the individuals in the system work very hard. So one way to approach the problem is to start at the micro level by thinking about how many transplants one doctor at a national-level transplant centre performs in a year. For example, in a report from 2013, a surgeon describes performing 246 transplants in a year. When you subtract weekends and holidays, the average year contains approximately 250 working days; so the surgeon essentially performed one transplant for every working day of the year. Obviously this surgeon is a very hard-working fellow, but thats not actually such an extraordinary schedule; because prisoners of all stripes are often made available in batches, organ transplants are usually performed in batches as well. The surgeon might have performed two or even three on a Single day and then gone for several days without performing any transplants at all. Transplant teams have to work on weekends and holidays too, and the tendency of organ sourcing to careen between feast and famine means that a national-level transplant center does not operate with only a single transplant surgeon; even ata bare minimum, a centre will have at least two or three transplant teams. So we can begin by premising a common sense proposition, a notional number, to represent the absolute lowest end of the range for the average national level transplant centre: one per day, or 365 transplants per year. Is the average of one transplant per day for each Ministry-approved transplant center credible? The short answer is yes, providing one is wedded to a skeptical approach. Put another way, even if one hadnt read this report at all, it would be exceedingly difficult to reject one transplant per day as unrealistically high. To reflect the size differences, we assumed that while national-level civilian and military transplant centres perform 360", "tokens": 1637, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "one per day on average, a designated transplant centre performs one transplant every two days. To reflect differences of opinion over the ramp-up time for approved transplant centres we assumed 14 years of operation rather than 15. We further assumed that a non-approved transplant centre performs two transplants a week, while a non-approved transplant centre performs one transplant per week (and these centres were active for seven years). Table 10.5 The low scenario: back-of-the-envelope estimate of total transplants conducted by 712 liver & kidney transplant centers since 2000 Annual Hospital Type Number ot Transplants Per Operating Years Totals, Expressed P 7 7 EP 2 in Thousands Hospitals Hospital National-level Civilian Transplant Centres National-level Mili mary 23 365 Transplant Centres Designated Transplant 168 Centres Non-approved Large Transplant 405 104 Centres Non-approved Medi edium 161 59 Transplant Centres Total Transplants Total Annual Average Transplant Volume ~ 900 thousand ~ 60 thousand The low scenario is just short of one million transplants over 15 years and instead of 90 thousand per year, ee _ the rate is 60,000. Earlier in this chapter, we determined that minimum requirements set by the state is equivalent to about 1.4 million transplants performed by the 712 transplant hospitals. This total includes 1 million carried out by the 146 approved transplant centers over 15 years, which translates to an average of 456 transplants per hospital per year, or in back-of-the-envelope speak, 1.25 transplants per hospital per day. In short, the differences are far less glaring than one might expect. However, because we are immersed in the data, it is hard for us not to see the low scenario and the minimum requirement scenario as understatements; neither one fully takes into account highly productive transplant 361\ncenters. For example, most national transplant centers have the capacity to perform more than 1,000 transplants a year, with some exceeding 4,000 and even 8,000 per year. For example, Beijing No. 309 Hospital has 393 beds and has the capacity to perform more than 4,000 transplants per year. 1884 On the civilian side, Tianjin Central Hospitals Oriental Organ Transplant Center has at least 500 transplant beds and claims to have a 131% utilization, which means that it is capable of performing more than 8,000 transplants a year. The Shanghai Orient Hepatobiliary Surgery Center had 742 beds but later moved to a new campus and further expanded. Even the minimum requirement scenario is not very taxing for the average transplant centers resources: 456 transplants a year requires fewer than 40 hospital beds, assuming a 30-day hospitalization period (or 25 beds for a 20-day hospitalization period, because many hospitals have set up transplant clinics, which greatly reduce the length of hospitalization). Where hospitals listed extremely low bed counts online, our investigators made recorded calls to verify the number of beds available for transplants. In some cases, they were told that the hospital could appropriate additional transplant beds as needed. They also found a few hospitals in which liver transplant patients typically stay for less than two weeks, such as the hospital of Xian Jiaotong University and Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University. 188 Transplant surgeries are conducted in both dedicated transplant centers and in regular surgery departments. For each hospital with adequate data available, we estimate the number of beds used to perform transplants by adding the reported bed counts for dedicated centers and a fraction of reported bed counts for hepatobiliary and urologic surgery departments known to conduct transplants. The question, then, is what fraction of beds in non-dedicated departments are used for transplants. The Ministry of Healths Notice Regarding the Management and Regulation of Liver, Kidney, Heart, and Lung Transplantation Capabilities issued in 2006 imposes the following requirements for non-dedicated surgery\ndepartments carrying out organ transplants: 1886 Hepatobiliary surgery departments: 80+ beds in total, including 15+ beds dedicated to liver transplants and no fewer than 10 ICU beds; Urologic surgery departments: 40+ beds in total, including 20+ beds dedicated to kidney transplants and no fewer than 10 ICU beds. Excluding ICU beds these requirements translate to nearly 20% of beds in non-dedicated departments used for liver transplants and 50% for kidney transplants. It should be noted that the distinction between dedicated and non-dedicated transplant departments is becoming increasingly blurred, as we have observed hospitals that have nominally merged their dedicated transplant centers back into their more generic surgery departments in recent years, perhaps to avoid scrutiny over the capacity of their dedicated transplant centers. Our data set is gathered from publicly available information and likely understates the presence and scale of dedicated transplant centers these hospitals operate. Furthermore, it has been shown that these transplant centers can add beds or even relocate beds from other departments as needed, so the stated bed counts are not absolute. 362 Finally, the hospitals we analyzed place a heavy emphasis on transplant operations; many of their transplant departments are elevated as key disciplines, transplantation is their most profitable activity, and at least 50 of the hospitals presidents are transplant specialists and/or simultaneously director of their transplant organizations. Given these factors, we also created a high scenario which doubles the rate of permitted hospitals; national- level civilian and military transplant centres perform two per day on average, while a designated transplant centre performs one transplant per day. Table 10.6 The high scenario: back-of-the-envelope estimate of total transplants conducted by 712 liver & kidney transplant centers since 2000 Annual Number of \" Totals, Expressed Transplants Per Operating Years Hospitals P : P 5 in Thousands Hospital Hospital Type National-level Civilian Transplant Centres National-level Military Transplant Centres Designated Transplant 320 Centres Non-approved Large Transplant Centres Non-approved Medium Transplant Centres ~ 1.5 million Total Annual A verage ~ 100 thousand Transplant Volume\nThe result is 1.5 million over 15 years; 100,000 transplants a year.

The explosive growth of transplantation in China led to an unprecedented expansion in the immunosuppressant market, which reached 10 billion RMB by March 2006. 1887 The cost of immunosuppressants for each transplant recipient is the highest in the first year and decreases thereafter. This cost is roughly between 30,000 and 70,000 RMB, averaging 40,000 RMB per year.1888 However, this cost can be even lower. According to liver transplant expert Yan Lvnan of West China Hospital in 2006, the hospital can control the cost to be around 30,000 RMB for the first year and an average of 10,000 RMB per year for subsequent years.!889 How many transplant recipients are covered by the 10-billion-RMB immunosuppressant market? We assume the number of organ transplants performed each year is constant and the average survival period\nis 5 years.!899 We also assume the cost of immunosuppressants for each recipient is 30,000 RMB per year. Total market value for immunosuppressant RMB = total transplant recipients * annual cost of immunosuppressants 10 billion RMB = total transplant recipients * 30,000 RMB Hence, the total number of recipients in the five years before 2006 is 330,000, which amounts to an average of 66,600 per year. Scaling it to a 15-year time period from 2000 to 2015, the total number of transplant recipients by 2015 would be 66,600 * 15 = 999,000 = 1 million. This number is quite close to and provides good cross-verification for the number of transplants we estimated earlier based on the minimum number of hospital beds. Moreover, the market size for immunosuppressants after 2006 should be larger, and continued increase in the market share of domestic immunosuppressants would have reduced the drug cost further. In addition, the immunosuppressant costs for many foreign patients who received organ transplants in China are not included in the 10 billion RMB (especially during the peak of transplant tourism prior to 2007). 365 VI.", "tokens": 333, "label": "medium"}

{"text": "When an organ is removed from the donor, it must be kept in preservation solution, and the transplant operation must take place within a limited time. According to the Notice on Management Regulations for Liver, Kidney, Heart and Other Transplantation Technologies issued by the Ministry of Health, the time should not exceed 24 hours for kidneys, 15 hours for livers, and 6 hours for hearts.1891\nThe other main factor affecting the usable ratio is geography. Until 2013, China did not have a formal national organ sharing network. Tissue matching was mostly done within specific hospitals or regions.192 Unavoidably, given the time limits involved in how quickly organs must be used after being extracted from a body, many organs in China were wasted as a result. In fact, for many bodies, only one organ has been utilized.189 It was not until October 2013 that the National Health and Family Planning Commission announced the (Trial) Regulations for Obtaining Organs from Voluntary Donors and Organ Assignment,!94 which required all 165 approved hospitals to use a new National Organ Sharing Network; it also required all donated organs to be allocated by this system. Since then, the National Health and Family Planning Commission has required all transplant centers to register their patients to build a national waiting list. There is an unwritten allocation rule that organ sources can be accessed locally only. Local hospitals have local monopoly control over local organ sources. Some local hospitals have abundant organ sources but cannot find suitable matching recipients so many organs are wasted. Hospitals in other regions, short of organ sources, have to try to obtain them from hospitals in localities which control abundant organ sources. 1895 Due to the strict limitations of the enduring times of the organs for transplantation, there are high technical demands on the transplant centers to conduct transplant with multiple organs from the same donor in order. Until recently, very few institutions in China were capable of procuring and transplanting multiple organs from a single donor. According to a media report from December 2011, only two hospitals in China had this capability in December 2011:189 one was Peoples Liberation Army No. 303 Hospital, and the other was the Tongji Organ Transplant Research Institute of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology.", "tokens": 378, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "We believe that the utilization ratio of \"donor organs\" in Chinas transplant centers are much lower than those of well-established organizations in other countries. In the past two years, the Chinese regime intentionally advertised in its state-run media that, in certain cases, one donor's organs were used in several transplants. Our findings indicate that such cases are rare, and we believe that most reports serve to cover up organ sources. 366 Chapter Eleven: A Crime lI. ORGANS EXTRACTED FROM LIVING SOURCES Living transplants in mainland China differ from those in the rest of the world. In China, it is common practice to excise whole vital organs from living sources. A single kidney can be removed while still preserving the quality of the donors life, but extracting both kidneys, a heart, or a liver kills the donor. Chinese hospitals and transplant centres often write about their capabilities in various forums - thats why this Update is possible - yet the crucial medical distinction of whether the donor will live or die rarely appears in the literature. Instead Chinese transplant hospitals simply claim to have adequate supplies of young and healthy organ donors. Little distinction is made between extracting a single kidney (not necessarily lethal) and extracting a whole vital organ such as a liver. Instead, it appears to be simply a matter of specialization. For example, Chinese Medical Universitys China International Transplantation Network Assistance Centre (CITNAC) overseas website emphasized that in China we carry out living donor kidney transplants. It is completely different from cadaver kidney transplants you hear about in Japanese hospitals and dialysis centers...compared to cadaver kidney transplants in Japan, what is offered here is much safer and more reliable. 1897 Q/A Online In China we carry out living donor kidney transplants.

In medical papers published by doctors from transplant hospitals, donors are often described as free of hepatitis, fatty liver, malignant tumors and chronic disease; no long term medication history; and no history of alcohol consumption. Most of these papers cited warm ischemia times (WIT) of less than 10 minutes with some even listed as 0 minutes. The majority of the organ sources were from cadavers, brain-dead donors, and no-heartbeat cadavers. Zhang Xiaodong, director of the Kidney Transplant Center at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, said, After the heart stops beating, the circulation stops, and this will cause organs to fail. The tolerable WIT is 3 to 4 minutes for hearts, 5 to 8 minutes for livers, 30 minutes for kidneys, and 24 hours for corneas.1899\nOrgans are transplantable only when the time and location of a donor's death are known in advance and the organ procurement team is well prepared. Thus, vital organs from those who have died outside of a hospital (e.g. in car accidents or other trauma), would involve intolerable warm ischemia times and are not viable for transplant. In China, medical personnel usually go to the execution grounds to retrieve organs from prisoners right after execution. Brain-dead organ donors have become the main source of transplant organs outside of China for decades, as such organs could have the shortest warm ischemia time possible. Because Chinese tradition requires bodies to be preserved intact after death, China has neither brain death legislation nor significant voluntary organ donation. Xinhua News Agency reported in August, 2005 that among countries capable of transplantation, China is the only country without brain death legislation.19 As a result, 90% of Chinese doctors, as of August 22, 2014, were not aware of the criteria for verifying brain death.1991 The number of organs sourced from brain-dead donors in China is negligible. On July 25, 2006, Yangcheng Evening News published a report titled The first successful lung transplant from a brain-dead donor. Dr. Chen Zhonghua said, Ms. Yang, a 39-year-old woman, is the first voluntary brain-dead organ donor in our country. ... This is the first case that met international criteria for a brain-dead donor.1902 The Organ Donation Management Commission of China was established on August 1, 2006. Dr. Chen Zhonghua acted as the first Executive Chairman of the Organ Donation Management Commission of China.193 In July 2010, an article in the Organ Transplantation journal claimed that since 2001, when Dr. Chen Zhonghua and his team began promoting organ sourcing for transplants from the brain dead, there have been over 60 successful organ donations after brain death in China. 199\nDonations after cardiac death (DCD) were another commonly listed organ source in China's transplant centers. Warm ischemia times of 0 to 5 minutes with \"no-heartbeat cadavers have become a standard practice of Chinese transplant doctors. 368 The Tianjin Medical Journal reported in 2009 that, between 2004 and 2008, the Tianjin Organ Transplant Center had excised 1,600 livers.19 Based on that, Shen Zhongyang, director of the center, created a surgical procedure for extracting livers from non-heart beating cadavers which could keep the warm ischemia time to 5 minutes or less. This procedure has been adopted widely in China.!99 Liu Yongfeng, director of China Medical Universitys Institute of Organ Transplantation, also created a rapid, comprehensive excision technique for abdominal organs, which he claimed could reduce both organ damage and warm ischemic time. It is a widely-used excision technique in many hospitals in China.1997 According to Chen Zhonghua, between 2003 and August 2009, only 130 citizens successfully donated their organs after death in mainland China.!98 The liver sources used by the Tianjin Organ Transplant Center alone have exceeded the number of citizen organ donations in all of China. Here are two examples on how the China's transplant doctors excise organs with a short warm ischemia time. Case Study: Living Heart Procurement The Henan Medical Research journal published an article by the doctors of the Armed Police Corps Hospital of Henan in 2003 (Volume 12, Issue 2) titled Experience of an orthotopic heart transplant, which describes the key points of an organ procurement as follows: 179? e The key to donor heart procurement is systemic heparinization (2mg/kg); e To irrigate the aortic root with cold cardioplegic solution to stop the heart, and cut the superior vena cava 4cm above the right atrium...speedily delivering the donor heart to the operating room.", "tokens": 831, "label": "heavy"}

This is corroborated by the 3-minute warm ischemia time. The 85-minute cold ischemia time indicates that the donor organ procurement and transplant into the recipient took place at the same location. 370 Case Study: Combined Living Heart-Lung Extracting Process Xijing Hospital, affiliated with the Fourth Medical Military University, performed a combined heart-lung transplant on May 26, 2008. The procurement process was described as follows: 1719 After being declared a brain-dead patient, the donor was intubated.

{"text": "Clearly, the purpose of intubation was not to resuscitate the donor but rather for the purpose of excising organs from a living body.

The clinical requirements for declaring brain death requires three conditions, all of which must be present: deep coma, lack of brainstem reflexes, and lack of automatic breathing. Directly diagnosing brain death without intubation and resuscitation violates medical ethics.

What unknown procedure enabled the hospitals to harvest fresh organs so soon after the deaths? Or does the phrase young adults after sudden deaths refer to executions as well? According to a regulation issued by the Chinese Ministry of Health,!92 once a kidney is removed from a body, it must be transplanted within 24 hours. The time limit for livers and hearts are 15 hours and 6 hours, respectively. Ideally, the donor organ should be transplanted immediately after the donors death, or directly taken from a living donor. Emergency liver transplants are surprisingly common as this report from the Dalian Evening News recounts:!926 On July 12, 2003, a 50-year-old Taiwanese named Liu Dongquan was admitted to the Organ Transplant Center of the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University. The next day, the patient fell into a coma and needed an immediate liver transplant. Two days later (on the 15), a matched liver was found in Tangshan, Hebei Province.

WANG LIJUN'S HUMAN BODY EXPERIMENTS The Experiments On the night of February 6, 2012, the head of Chongqings Public Security Bureau got in a car and drove to the American consulate in Chengdu, looking for asylum. The man was Wang Lijun, one of the most high-profile law enforcement officials in China, in part because he had been hand-picked and promoted by Bo Xilai, a dark- horse contender for the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and potentially the top Party leadership. What interests us in this update is the specific medical innovations that took place under Wang Lijuns command.!%7 1928 In May 2003, Wang Lijun was transferred by Liaoning Governor Bo Xilai to Jinzhou as police commissioner. Wang does not have a medical background, but soon after he took up the position, he established an On-Site Psychological Research Center located under the Jinzhou Public Security Bureau. He worked for 29 universities and research institutions with such titles as a part-time professor, Ph.D. advisor, and chairman.!?29 On September 17, 2006, in his acceptance speech for an award of two million RMB for the Guanghua Innovation Special Contribution Award, Wang stated that our scientific and technological achievements in the field are the crystallization of the thousands of intensive on-site tests and the efforts of many of our people ... to those who have served in the police force for many years, when we see a person go to the place of execution and in a matter of minutes this persons life is transformed and extended into the lives of other people, it is soul-stirring. This is a momentous undertaking. 192\nRen Jinyang, Secretary-General of the Guanghua Foundation, further remarked, Professor Wang Lijun and the research center carried out basic research and clinical experiments to solve the problem of recipients body rejecting the extracted organs for transplant after lethal injections. They researched and developed a brand new protective solution, which is used to provide a perfusion treatment for livers and kidneys both in vivo and in vitro. Through animal experiments, in vitro experiments, and clinical application, they have made step-by-step scientific success in making it possible for an organ to be accepted by the recipient.!9! In September 2004, Sanlian Life Weekly contained an article titled Tianjin Survey: Asias Number One in Organ Transplantation, 1934 in which the head medical resident at Tianjin Oriental Organ Transplant Center, Zhang Yamin, said that donor organ procurement is costly, that a single organ perfusion preservation solution is not a small expenditure, and that every major organ requires four bags of preservation solution at 5,000 RMB each. At the beginning, there were no domestic manufacturers of perfusion solutions, so they had to use preservation solutions brought back from Japan, bag by bag, by Shen Zhongyang. Wang Lijuns drug experimentation with living subjects included improving medication for lethal injections to reduce complications from rejection responses after organ extraction and transplantation, as well as improving organ preservation solutions. 374 In June 2005, an example of his research was reported by Liao Shen Evening News as the entire process of lethal injections in executed prisoners, which was intended to help more people understand the research.!?33 At 5:00 am on June 9, 2005, in Cuijiatun in the Jinzhou City Economic and Technological Development Zone, a field experiment and study was carried out with a lethal injection. A researcher gave an introduction:\nThrough the entire process of a convicts death via lethal injection, the healthy persons vital signs will be measured before and after the injection, the amount of poison residue in various organs afterwards, the prisoners psychological changes when facing death ... this data will provide important help to organ transplantation after death by lethal injection and other aspects of human organ transplantation. Whether in China or abroad, this is cutting- edge research. The reporter described the experts gathered at the execution site as if they were staff of a research laboratory. The reporter referred to Wang Lijun as director of the Psychological Research Center. The reporter also listed professor and doctoral advisor Xi Huanjiu, the dean of Jinzhou Medical College, and other experts in medicine, criminal investigation, and psychology. They were described as conducting psychological analyses and clinical research on reportedly violent criminals who received the lethal injections. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce website, Jinzhou Public Security Bureaus On-Site Psychological Research Center works with over ten universities and medical institutions, among which are the China Criminal Police College, Peking University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Northeastern University of Finance and Economics, China Medical University, Jinzhou Medical School and the Peoples Liberation Army No. 205 Military Hospital.", "tokens": 769, "label": "heavy"}

He continuously intensified the study on atraumatic dissection. 375 Photos: Wangs team conducting studies on atraumatic dissection at Chongqing Psychological Research Center A Killing Apparatus On August 27, 2014, Beijing Youth Daily reported that Wang Lijun had been awarded 254 patents in his office in Chongging, 211 of which were submitted in 2011, an average of one application every 1.7 days. The report also mentioned a high-tech product called the Primary Brain Stem Injury Impact Apparatus. 1936 The patents inventors were Wang Lijun and the fourth laboratory of the Field Research Institute of Surgery in Daping Hospital, affiliated with the Third Military Medical University. They published a paper in Trauma Surgery in 2008 Issue 2, entitled Finite Element Simulation and its Clinical Significance of Traumatic Brain Injury Caused by Temporal Impact in the Quasistatic State.1937 The paper claimed that the purpose of this study was to Establish a simulation of a traumatic brain injury caused by a temporal impact ... discuss the biomechanics of brain injuries caused by a temporal impact...results: the pressure at the hit point of the temporal bone and intracranial pressure increased with increased hit velocity...the results of the simulation matched the results of the biological experiment...this study has important significance for the diagnosis and prevention of brain injuries caused by temporal impacts. The paper referred to a software simulation in which this process would be explored, to provide data for real- world scenarios. The paper also set out an experiment, stating that until October 2007, twelve corpse heads were used for the impact tests. All of the subjects for the experiments were male, age 26-38, with an average age of 31. However, the overall purpose of the study seems contrary to its claim of saving lives. Instead, it studies injuries to the brain at different levels, (following injuries resulting from violent impacts to the primary brain stem, victims are left with various levels of cognitive and sensory motor dysfunctions, which can lead to respiratory and circulatory malfunctions that can be life-threatening!938) which could be used to determine how best to kill; an impact to the temple that is placed just right can cause brain stem injury, loss of consciousness, and even brain death. The heart is still beating, and various organs and tissues continue to live. This impact is an effective alternative to lethal injection while maintaining organ function and reducing rejection responses. In the China Patent Search System, we can find the primary brain stem injury impact apparatus !9? under patent number 201120542042X (pictured below); the inventors are Wang Lijun and the same authors of the paper who conducted the impact experiment on the 12 heads. The instructions also claim that the device has 376 a simple structure, is easy to produce, and adapted to promote the application. The protection of utility model patents is ten years from the filing date in China.

How is it possible that we have accumulated so many corpses and organ specimens in recent years after the Cultural Revolution? I asked the teacher whether these bodies were donated, but the teacher told me not to ask. Later I discovered that in the suburban district of Changchun there is a corpse processing plant. Today in China, do we really have so many cadavers from voluntary donors, so many that we need corpse plants? Bodies of infants and young children are also processed there. Are the Chinese parents really so noble as to donate the remains of their own deceased infants? Dalian Hongfeng Biology Technology Co., Ltds body exhibition in Europe was called The Human Body. From February 2 to July 31, 2012, 200 real human body specimens were on display in Dublin, Ireland. 1948 Additional exhibits were scheduled that year simultaneously in other European countries: February 24 to May 27 in Budapest, Hungary, where more than 150 complete corpses and body parts were exhibited.!949 From March 10 to June 10, The Human Body was on display in Prague, Czech Republic.19 From June 16 to September 9, The Human Body visited Ostend, Belgium.!%!

The source of origin is indicated as body without record.1953 According to regulations and autopsy rules issued by Chinas Ministry of Health on February 22, 1979, undocumented corpses remaining unclaimed after a month can be used by medical colleges after the approval of a competent authority or the police department.!9+ Undocumented corpses must be embalmed if they are to be stored beyond a month before use.

Excerpt of Conversation with Sui Hongjin, Chairman of Dalian Hongfeng Below is the translation of a transcript of a call made to Sui Hongjin by an investigator from the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong.!9? The investigator assumed the identity of a Party investigator and asked Sui about his business operations, including the provenance of the corpses. The call was made in late 2012, a period of great political uncertainty in China, not long after the purge of Bo Xilai. Investigations were being launched into many of Bos former colleagues, as well as his wife, Gu Kailai. These conditions would have helped to give Sui Hongjin the impression that he was speaking to a Party disciplinary investigator. Investigator: What channels served as your main source of bodies? Sui Hongjin: Dozens of corpses came from Public Security. They were procured by the Public Security Bureau. Investigator: Then they are from the police. How many cadavers have you received thus far? Sui Hongjin: I cant remember now, perhaps dozens...if you come in person to investigate, I will discuss the matter with you. Its not convenient to talk on the phone.

SOURCES Prisoners Sentenced to Death The Government of China changed its official position on organ sources numerous times. As early as 2001,a doctor from China testified at the United States Congress!93 that the Government of China was using organs from executed prisoners without consent. The Government denied this claim until July 2005, when Huang Jiefu, then-Deputy Minister of Health, stated at the World Organ Transplant Conference that most transplant organs in China were obtained from executed prisoners.!? On March 9, 2006, a woman with the pseudonym Annie made a public statement that there had been large- scale harvesting of organs in China sourced from living Falun Gong practitioners.19 Three weeks later, spokesperson Qin Gang for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded, \"it is a lie to claim that organs are being taken from executed prisoners without their consent.!96 In April 2006, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Health, Mao Qunan, claimed that the main source of organs in mainland China is voluntary donations from citizens at death and denied Chinas exploitation of death-row prisoners organs for transplantation.!967", "tokens": 437, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "Nine months later, in January 2007, Mao Qunan stated that China was actually using organs from executed prisoners for transplantation. Since then, the Government has maintained that these organs come from executed prisoners. In December 2008, Huang Jiefu published an article in The Lancet, entitled Government Policy and Organ Transplantation in China, stating that over 90% of the organs are sourced from death-row prisoners.1968 Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite Television, a station authorized by the Government of China to broadcast in mainland China, reported in March 2015 an interview with Huang Jiefu.!9? The Government used this channel to subtly revise its stance on the too sensitive issue of organ sourcing.", "tokens": 109, "label": "light"}
{"text": "In answering a reporters question regarding the number of executed prisoners being much smaller than that of organ transplants, Huang Jiefu said: What you are mentioning is too sensitive an issue, so I cannot describe it very clearly to you. It is easy to get a clear idea just by thinking of the situation-for such a country [China]: there is no transparency, what the sources are, you cannot know; how many have been done remains a secret as well...in fact, many things are a mess, you cannot know clearly how many. The Government of China considers its number of executions a state secret. According to Amnesty International, between 1995 and 1999, a total of 8401 Chinese citizens were sentenced to death, giving an annual average of 1,680. Between 2000 and 2005, it was 1616 per year. 197 The numbers have fluctuated from year to year, but the overall average number for the periods remained the same before and after the persecution of Falun Gong began. Between 2006 and 2008, the average was 1,066, 197! 1972 1973 an indication of fewer executions. Amnesty International stopped reporting the number of executions in China in 2009. 384\nThese figures were calculated by totaling publicly available reports of individual executions. Amnesty International considered these totals to be an understatement. They wrote: \"Credible sources suggest that between 7,500 to 8,000 people were executed in 2006. The official statistics remain a state secret, making monitoring and analysis problematic.\" 1974 Other organizations, such as Duihua Foundation, gave estimates similar to what Amnesty International attributed to credible sources. 197 Duihua calculated its total by extrapolation from the death penalty case load of individual Chinese legal practitioners. Although the figures by different organizations with different methodologies varied, their conclusions and time trends are similarthe actual figure of the prisoners executed is believed to be much higher than China's official data, and the overall average figure of the prisoners sentenced to death before 1999 remains consistent with that after 1999, when the persecution of Falun Gong began.!976 Since January 2007, when the law was changed to require that all death penalty cases be reviewed by the Supreme Peoples Court of China, the number of executions has decreased. For example, in 2007, 15% of death penalty cases were dismissed by the review.!?77 To meet transplantation standards, sources must not have these diseases or conditions: fatty liver, hepatitis, cancer, infections, diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, HIV antibodies, syphilis antibodies; high blood pressure, heart disease, tuberculosis, or history of liver or kidney disease. In addition, one out of ten people in mainland China carry the hepatitis B virus.!?78 The percentage is much higher in the prison population. The percentage of death row prisoners who would qualify as organ sources is low. In September 2013, Zhu Jiye, director of the organ transplant research center at Peking University and director of the hepatobiliary surgery department of the Peking University Peoples Hospital, told China Economic Weekly: \"Before the launch of the pilot donation project in 2010, organs from executed prisoners accounted for almost all organ organs. In our hospital, we have done 4,000 liver and kidney\ntransplants in a year.", "tokens": 524, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "These organs all came from death row prisoners. !97? Thus, the number of annual liver and kidney transplants performed by just one hospital far exceeds the Amnesty International calculation of the number of executed prisoners nationwide. Because of the high volume of organ transplants performed in China since the rapid growth began in 2000, the claim that all or most transplant organs came from executed prisoners is contradicted by the total number of transplants performed. The Claim that China no Longer Uses Executed Prisoners China Network published an article on March 5, 2013: Ministry of Health: Organ transplants stating that China will no longer rely on executed prisoners within two years. !989 At the China Organ Transplant 385 Conference in November 2013, Huang Jiefu announced the Hangzhou Resolution, promising to discontinue the use of organs from executed prisoners by June 2014.198! In February 2014, The Transplantation Society (TTS) published an open letter to the Chinese president entitled, \"To Xi Jinping, President of the Peoples Republic of China: Chinas Fight against Corruption in Organ Transplantation.!?82 The letter stated, The Tianjin website (www.cntransplant.com) continues to recruit international patients who are seeking organ transplants, and First hand reports from our Chinese colleagues and a number of investigations suggest that the practice of obtaining organs from prisoners in China involves notorious transactions between transplant surgeons and local judicial and penal officials. In fact, a Chinese organ broker, Omar Healthcare Service, was still running online advertisements soliciting patients in the West to receive organ transplants in China, suggesting that Chinese transplant tourism was still ongoing.!?83 In December 2014, China state-owned media declared that from January 1, 2015 onwards, China would stop using executed prisoners organs for transplants, and that citizens voluntary organ donations after death would be the only source for organ transplants.!?84* This announcement was made by Huang Jiefu, former Deputy Minister of Health and now director of the Chinese Human Organ Donation and Transplantation Commission.", "tokens": 322, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Voluntary Organ Donation Traditional Chinese custom requires bodies to be preserved whole after death. Organ transplantation in China began in the 1970s, but by 2003, the number of voluntary donations remained at zero.!?8 In May 2010, an article published in the Journal of Medicine and Philosophy, likened organ donation in China to a wilderness.1986 According to Huang Jiefu, before 2010, there was no organ donation system in China. The national organ donation system started in 2014,1987 In March 2010, China piloted an organ donation program in Shanghai, Tianjin, Liaoning, Shandong, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Fujian, Xiamen, Nanjing, Wuhan, and eventually in 19 provinces and cities. 1988 This program was jointly run by the Ministry of Health and China Red Cross. On February 25, 2011, the Yangzi Evening News noted that, since the launch of the Nanjing Organ Donation pilot program in March of 2010, not a single voluntary organ donation had been received. Over the past 20 years, only three people had donated their organs in Nanjing City.1?8 In Shanghai, the first organ donation from a deceased organ donor happened on August 21, 2013. Yet there are 11 transplant centers in Shanghai approved by the Ministry of Health.!97 New Beijing Paper reported in March 2012 that 207 voluntary donors had donated organs after death over two years nationwide.!??! The title of the article was Organ donation pilot program did not solve the dilemma of the supply and demand disparity.

At the same time, he projected that in 2015 the number of transplant surgeries in China would pass 10,000 and might surpass the historical record set in 2006.1?76 In 2014, at the Hangzhou Transplant Congress, Dr. Ye had expressed frustration that around 70% of 165 approved transplant centers showed no interest in developing civilian organ donation programs. Doctors indicated that no matter how well the computer matching and deployment system works, it doesnt make sense if there is no organ supply and that even when a donated organ became available it was often of poor quality and cannot be used. According to Ye, there was a persistently large gap between supply and demand. 1997 Huang Jiefu indicated in his interview with Beijing Youth Daily on November 18, 2015 that the organ donation system in China does not function in practice, because the Red Cross and the National Planning Commission, the two most important organizations in organ donation, did not actually coordinate with each other: \"The two departments jointly established a national organ donation and transplantation committee on March 1, 2014, but it exists in name only. So far no meeting has been held yet.\"!?9\nAccording to an article titled Many Challenges in Organ Donation published by Guangming Daily on September 3, 2013, donor organ coordinators stated that among 100 potential organ donors about half were ineligible because they could not meet the requirements for donation.

In 2015, investigators from the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong called the institutes for voluntary organ donations in China. Most did not answer the phone. The few offices that did answer the phone indicated that there were tiny numbers of people who had registered to donate, and that the number of successful donations was extremely low.290 On December 6, 2015, the staff at the Red Cross Society of Beijing confirmed that organ donation was still in the preparatory stage. The Beijing Red Cross did not even have a donation office at the time and had not yet arranged a single case of organ donation.299! Yet there are 20 state-approved transplant centers in Beijing, many of them with the capacity to carry out thousands of transplants per year. 387 On December 17, 2015, a female staff member at the Shanghai Red Cross organ donation office in Huangpu District reported that her office had begun carrying out donation work at the beginning of the previous year and that the city of Shanghai claimed 5 successful organ donations since the donation system began.29 Yet there are 11 hospitals in Shanghai which have state approval to carry out organ transplants and all of them are capable of carrying out a large volume of transplants. On December 12, 2015, a Tianjin Red Cross worker reported that since an organ donation database was created in 2003, there had been a total of 170 donated organs.299 Yet Tianjins Oriental Organ Transplant Center has over 500 transplant beds and is estimated to have an annual capacity of at least 5,000 transplants. On May 14, 2015, a female staff member at the organ donation office at the Red Cross chapter in Qinhuangdao, Hebei Province said: There are people who have registered for organ donations at some point in their life, so they intend to donate their organs. But there are not many cases like this. Moreover, none of them have actually donated their organs yet. When the person was young, they register to be an organ donor. But we have to wait until they pass away. However, when the person passes away, his or her organs may not be usable due to changes in health. We cannot use organs that are diseased. As of now, we havent had any donated livers or hearts.29 In March 2015, Liu Zhonghua, chief physician of the urologic surgery department of Henan Peoples Hospital said: It is almost impossible for Chinese people to donate their organs. You simply cant find anyone; you nearly cant find anyone. If they are not related to someone by blood, who would be willing to give you their organs?200 In July 2015, the on-duty staff at the organ donation office of the Red Cross chapter in Jiaozuo said: There are some people who registered for organ donation, but the number is very, very small; and you must wait for them to die of natural causes before organ donation can take place; the number of people who donate their organs after they die from accidents is very, very few ... As for those who donates organs after death, they cant make the decision, since theyre deceased. So their family has to call us to give consent for the donation. Even if the deceaseds close relatives consent to the donation, sometimes all it takes is one word froma distant relative, and the family changes their mind about giving consent for the donation.2996 An early interview reported by Sohu Health addressed the question, Are 1.5 million people in China waiting for death due to the low organ donation rate because there is no love? For the worlds most accepted way to obtain organs, almost all transplant doctors of China have said it is impossible. These doctors include Li Leishi, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and founder of the National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Diseases at the Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command.2997 388 Li Leishi, wrote in a 2008 article titled Organ donation after death exists in theory, but is difficult to do in reality: In China, for organ donation after the death of a citizen, from both the system and law there are no conditions for its existence ... when a death has occurred, contacting the family members of the dead and discussing the donation issue would already miss the best time [for transplantation], and the organs ischemia time is then too long and it cannot be used for transplant. So in China, organ donation after death does not exist in the system. In addition, China has no standard for defining brain death, and organ donation has no legal protection. 2008 To date, these issues have not yet seen substantive changes or improvements. In recent years, official state media have reported a few high-profile cases of individual human organ sales.29? The number of such reported transactions remains miniscule. As early as in April 2006, Sanlian Life Weekly reported that: China currently has a voluntary organ donation rate from living relatives of 1.1%. The control of over 98% of organ sources originate from outside of the Ministry of Health system.2010 The archived website of the China International Transplantation Network Assistance Center (CITNAC) reveals: in order to support the large number of organ transplant surgeries every year, we need to give all of our thanks to the support given by the government. In particular, the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, Public Security system, judicial system, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Civil Affairs have jointly promulgated laws to ensure that organ donations receive government support and protection. This is a one of its kind in the world.2011 Donation Discrepancies\nThe New York Times reported on April 6, 2016 that donation coordinator Cao Yanfang of the Zhejiang Province Human Organ Donation Management Center said that 2,766 people donated 7,785 organs in 2015 and that there were 66,000 donors on the state registry. Those aggregate figures, like the aggregate figures for transplants in general, conflict with individual figures. For transplants performed, looking at individual hospitals bring us to volumes far larger than the official aggregates. For organ donations, by looking at individual donation centers, we get figures far smaller than the official aggregates. There are two explanations for this discrepancy between overall donation figures and those aggregated from individual centers. One is that organs from prisoners are classified as donations. Huang Jiefu in March, 2014 stated that 389 \"[transplant reform] is not about not using organs from executed prisoners, but not allowing hospitals or medical personnel to engage in private transactions with human organs.\"29!4 \"We will regulate the issue by including voluntary organ donations by executed prisoners in the nation's public organ donation system.29! \"Once entered into our unified allocation system, they are counted as voluntary donations of citizens. The so-called death row organ donation doesn't exist any longer.\"29!4 On October 8, 2015, the British Medical Journal, in an article titled Chinas semantic trick with prisoner organs, 2915 co-authored by five medical experts from United States, Germany and Canada stated that The announcement of December 2014 itself is neither a law nor a governmental regulation. It is only at best a statement of good intentions but has no force of law. The announcement is not even mentioned in the policies of the PRC National Health and Family Planning Commission, which administers the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS). The article asserts that the Chinese authorities are simply playing word games by labeling prisoner organs as voluntary donations from citizens. On March 10, 2015, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that medical experts in United States, Germany, and Canada wrote open letters to medical journals to warn that\n\"China is still using death row inmates organs. The only difference is that these organs are now being classified as citizens voluntarily donated organs. This change will bypass international ethics, and their unethical practices might never stop. 2916 According to The New York Times article China Bends Vow, Using Prisoners Organs for Transplants, organs from prisoners, including those on death row, can still be used for transplants in China, and that this use has the backing of policymakers. Dr. Otmar Kloiber, the secretary general of the World Medical Association, said that the announcement in December by Huang Jiefu was an administrative trick.2917 A second explanation for the discrepancy between overall donation figures and the aggregate of what individual donation centres report is that Chinese hospitals are buying from impoverished family members of patients near death, who consent to the harvesting of organs from their loved ones. What health officials now call a donation system is, for the most part, a purchase and sale system with hospitals as brokers. Patients pay large sums for organs.", "tokens": 1464, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "The families of potential donors near death are offered large sums for their consent. Regarding the money patients pay for the purchase of organs, Huang Jiefu said: \"First of all, transplantation is an expensive operation; currently our social medical insurance does not cover organ transplantation. Transplantation belongs to high-end medical service, and not all patients can afford such an operation and the postoperative medical expenses.\" Regarding the money families of donors receive for the donation of organs, Huang Jiefu said: \"In the United States and other countries, the decision to donate relieves the family of the potential donor of any further financial risk. This removes a significant barrier to the 390\nconsideration of organ donation for the family by removing any financial disincentive for making the decision to donate a loved one's organs. In these countries, the donor processing and charges for procurement are passed to the recipient with the government health care system as a financial backstop. In China... [a] fully funded social security network is not in place; thus, the decision of a family to donate would burden them with further financial obligations. A financial system has to be put in place that would offset the charges from the hospital with respect to organ donation. In the transition from the pilot program to the national program, for donor families with a financial burden, China adopted a humanitarian assistance system featuring the spirit of fraternity and reciprocity. This system recognizes both the altruistic nature of the gift by recognizing the donor in a public manner and the financial burden from the decision to donate a family member's organs, which may encumber the family. The financial burden may be significant, especially in light of the median income in China.\" In an interview with Sina on March 3, 2015, Huang said: \"It is impossible for the organs from death-row prisoners and the organs donated by citizens to exist in the one and the same system. If our organ donation system is like that, people will not trust it; they will be afraid that the system is unjust and not transparent. Poor people donate organs, and rich people have the right to receive transplants. I agree with the view elaborated by the Global Times editorial, respect death-row prisoners and there will be more healthy people to participate in donation.'\"2918 The comment, \"Poor people donate organs, and rich people have the right to receive transplants, encapsulates the brokerage system hospitals are running, which is claimed to be the replacement of the prisoner system. For the distinction between rich and poor to make a difference, the funding given by the health system to the cajoled surviving relatives of those near death has to be more than just financially neutral.

The official Chinese line is that all transplants come from donations. Yet, total transplants, if one aggregates the work of individual hospitals, far exceeds the figure of 7,785 reported in April 2016 for 2015. There are two transplant systems running in China: a system however inappropriately described as a donation system, and a system outside the donation system. The donation system collects those few donations which really are voluntary, prisoner organs funneled through the donation system, and the organs of dying patients bought with the consent of their families. The non-donation system, which towers over the donation system, account for the bulk of organ transplants in China. Falun Gong Practitioners The medical field began to conduct human organ transplantation in the 1960s. There has been a tremendous development in China's human organ transplant industry after 1999. The timing of this growth corresponds to that of the Chinese Communist Party's persecution campaign against Falun Gong. 391 Our books, Bloody Harvest: Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China and The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem, have discussed transplant growth in China in detail and concluded that Falun Gong practitioners are the main victims targeted by the large-scale live organ transplant industry in China. According to an internal survey conducted by Chinas Public Security Bureau, by July 1999, at least 70 million people in mainland China were practicing Falun Gong.292 On July 20, 1999, the Chinese Communist Party leadership launched an eradication campaign against the practice of Falun Gong.292!", "tokens": 298, "label": "medium"}

The number of people petitioning the government in Beijing was at its highest between the beginning of 2000 and the end of 2001. The Public Security Bureau in Beijing determined that up to April 2001 a total of 830,000 Falun Gong practitioners had been registered or arrested. This figure does not include those who refused to give their names to police.2922 A large number of practitioners did not disclose their identities to avoid implicating their families or people in their workplaces and neighborhoods. The unidentified practitioners were not sent back to their hometowns.2923 According to a report by Chinas justice department, China had 670 operating prisons, holding a total of more than 1.5 million inmates.2924 2925 There were also 300 forced labour camps before the /aogai system was abolished at the end of 2013. 292 The book Laogai: The Machinery of Repression in China, published in 2009, stated that as many as 3 to 5 million people were imprisoned in laogai camps.2927 The U.S. Congressional Executive Committee on Chinas annual report for 20082928 noted that international observers believed that half of those incarcerated in Chinas forced labour camps were Falun Gong practitioners. Ethan Gutmann estimates that Falun Gong constituted about half of the laogai system in 2001 and then leveled off to 15 to 20% over the long term, translating to about 500,000 to 1,000,000 Falun Gong practitioners being detained in the laogai system at any given time. Many detention centres were built or expanded all over China to house the large number of Falun Gong practitioners who were arrested and detained.

Policy of Destruction On August 21, 2000, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security held a nationwide telephone conference to relay new orders that the practice of Falun Gong was to be eradicated in three months.2929 Du Daobin of Hubei Province reported in May 2003 that the local 610 Office, the Communist Party office charged with the repression of Falun Gong, had received instructions which stated, \"no law regulates the treatment of Falun 392 Gong practitioners,\" and \"death of Falun Gong practitioners from beating is nothing and shall be counted as suicide; the body shall be directly cremated without investigating the person's identification.\"2931 In October 9, 1984, the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Civil Affairs jointly promulgated the \"Provisional Regulations on the Use of Corpses or the Organs of Executed Prisoners.\"29?2 It allowed the corpses and organs of prisoners to be used under certain conditions: 1) the body was not collected, or the family refused to collect the body; or 2) the executed prisoner voluntarily gave his body or organs for use by medical or health units; or 3) the families have given consent.

{"text": "The law does not require a prisoner to be sentenced to death and then executed for his or her organs to be used. In the case of Falun Gong, the authorities also used the Provisional Regulations to prevent the families of the dead practitioners from claiming their bodies, which in turn facilitated forced organ harvesting and the unlawful sale of bodies. The authorities do not necessarily inform family members when a Falun Gong practitioner is arbitrarily detained in a re-education through labour camp. Moreover, many detained Falun Gong practitioners, in order to protect their family, friends, work colleagues and neighbors, do not self-identify once detained. For the non-self-identified, the authorities do not know who the family members are and cannot notify them. This combination of Chinese legal factors allows for the sourcing of organs from Falun Gong practitioners without either their consent or the consent of their family members, and whether or not they have been sentenced to death. Moreover, the numbers subject to this license to harvest organs is large, because of the large numbers of non-self-identified Falun Gong practitioners in detention. Blood Tests In detention centres, Falun Gong practitioners are frequently given blood tests and medical examinations, while other prisoners (with the exception of Uyghurs, Tibetans and certain House Christian groups who were also targeted) receive no such treatment. During the investigation, Ethan Gutmann interviewed over 50 Falun Gong practitioners who had been detained in labour camps and prisons in China, many of whom were forcibly given blood tests and unusual examinations. Many similar cases were recorded in Matas and Kilgours Bloody Harvest. The website Minghui.org publishes many firsthand accounts of Falun Gong practitioners all over China who had gone through such examinations. In April 2014, in Guizhou, Liaoning, Hunan, Hubei, Beijing and other locations, police entered practitioners homes and forcibly took blood samples and cheek swabs.

The Public Health newspaper reported in September 2003 that Huang Jiefu had held a lecture on Chinas organ transplant legislation in Xiangya Third Hospital of Central South University. He suggested that setting up an organ allocation network could resolve the chaotic situation of organ allocation and management. With the participation of the health administrative department, an organ allocation network at the provincial, regional and national levels could be gradually formed. The deployment of the network would prevent back-and-forth transportation of source organs and cut the surgical cost by half.

It is internally known as the \"610 Office,\" deriving its name from the date of its founding, June 10th, 1999. With a structure extending from top to bottom throughout the Party, government, and military, it has the power to command all police and judicial organs. This organization is akin to the Chinese Communist Partys Central Cultural Revolution Group, and is dedicated to carrying out the systematic eradication of the practice of Falun Gong. It is an ad hoc agency at the highest levels endowed with extraordinary and extralegal power. It later changed its name to the Central 395\nLeading Group on Dealing with Heretical Religions or Office of Maintaining Stability. The organization is directly under the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.2939 Central a | ae 610 Office ; crates = Provincial CCP committees / City CCP committees County and village CCP committees Neighborhood committees Figure 12.2: 610 Office & Chinese Communist Party Political Legal Committees organization 2? The 610 Office is the main organization created by the Communist Party to eliminate Falun Gong. It is nominally subordinate to the Political and Legal Affairs Committee. The Committees purview was expanded after the 610 Office was incorporated into it. The Committee and, in consequence, the 610 office, oversees the public security bureau, the procuratorate, and judicial systems. The Political and Legal Affairs Committee and 610 office have the power to control personnel and resources in the police, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the fields of finance, culture, education, science and technology, and health departments throughout the country. The regime mobilized the entire state apparatus in the campaign against Falun Gong.21 A propaganda campaign has been a key tool in the suppression of Falun Gong. Since the persecution began in July 1999, the 610 Office has used the countrys newspapers, television stations, radio stations, websites, and 396 loudspeakers in rural areas to broadcast anti-Falun Gong propaganda. It also has used Xinhua News Agency, China News Service, China News Agency, Party-controlled media overseas, and Chinese consulates to spread this propaganda globally. The demonization of Falun Gong provided a basis on which crimes against practitioners could be justified. In 2002, Jiang Zemin promoted Zhou Yongkang (who did not have prior experience in the public security system) from Party Secretary of Sichuan Province to Minister of Public Security, as well as Deputy Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Committee, in which role he cooperated with Committee Party Secretary Luo Gan to implement the suppression of Falun Gong nationwide.?*2\nZhou made the capture and repression of Falun Gong a major focus of domestic security work in China. During his tenure the quantity of transplants taking place in China - sourced from Falun Gong - continued to grow rapidly. Judicial systems sold organs to the transplant centres. Forensic hospitals actively conducted organ transplant. Special institutions under Public Security Bureaus, such as, Wang Lijun's Jinzhou and Chongqing Public Security Bureau On-Site Psychology Research Centres, carried out organ transplantation and human body experiments on a large scale. During the Communist Partys 17th National Congress in October 2007, Zhou Yongkang replaced Luo Gan as the Party Secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee. Zhou became head of the \"Central leading group to handle the Falun Gong issue and was placed on the Party's highest strategic tierthe Politburo Standing Committee. At the end of 2013, the new Chinese Communist Party leadership removed Zhou Yongkang under charges of corruption and plotting to stage a coup. But the machinery of the Falun Gong persecution has not stopped. Ministry of Health, National Population and Family Planning Commission, and Others The Ministry of Health (MOH) and later the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NPFPC) led the health care system in the transplantation of organs. In organizing, driving, and directly carrying out such activities, these agencies are fully responsible for overall planning, making policies, regulating and managing China's human organ transplant industry and the organ donation and allocation system.2*3 These agencies centrally coordinate and guide the Chinese organ transplantation systems: procurement and allocation, clinical care and services, post-operative registration, oversight, and donation. These agencies also organize and implement training and sharing in the regulations, policies, and techniques for transplantation. In particular, they evaluate the qualifications of the transplant institutions, as well as the capabilities and management of clinical practices. They also grant and manage permits to the qualified transplant centres.", "tokens": 857, "label": "heavy"}

New 397 capabilities and techniques have emerged and been extensively spreading, allowing live organ transplantation in China to grow into a large, industrialized operation in less than two decades. In March 2013, at the Twelfth National Peoples Congress, the former Ministry of Health and the National Population and Family Planning Commission were dissolved, and Huang Jiefu was relieved from his position as Deputy Minister of Health. Meanwhile, a new National Health and Family Planning Commission was founded.244 Huang Jiefu served as chairman of the China Organ Transplant Board. He was the chief editor of 11 surgery monographs and participated in the editing of 5 surgery monographs.24 On March 1, 2014, China Human Organ Donation and Transplantation Commission announced its establishment. It declared that, under the leadership of the National Health and Family Planning Commission and the China Red Cross Society, the Commission would work as a central management unit to guide and oversee the human organ transplant and donation system in China. Huang Jiefu was named the Commissions director.2* Since then, Huang Jiefu has been the spokesperson for China in the field of organ transplantation. Huangs new title, director of the Chinese Human Organ Donation and Transplant Committee, is not an official designation, according to Communist Party personnel information. The news section of the official Chinese Communist Party leadership repository lists Huangs titles as \"former Deputy Minister of Health\" and \"deputy director of the Central Health Committee.\"2948 It is also germane that on the website of the National Health and Family Planning Commission the Chinese Human Organ Donation and Transplantation Commission established in 2014 is not listed under any departmental structure. 249 Even though described as the central management agency for transplantation in China, the agency does not have an official website. It was announced at the inaugural meeting that its secretariat belongs to the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The Transplantation Commission appears to be a shell organization with no dedicated personnel or Offices. Huang Jiefus announced that China will discontinue the use of organs from prisoners on January 1, 2015. That announcement, itself, has no legal effect and cannot be traced to any officially promulgated policy statements or laws.

It is a tool used to sustain the Chinese Communist Partys control over China. From 1999 to May 2006, the Chinese Communist Party Central Military Commission held six special meetings on \"handling foreign-related religious issues,\" which mainly targeted Falun Gong.29>2 The General Logistics Department was authorized as the core unit to lead every level of the military to eradicate the practice of Falun Gong including the power to manage the secret detention facilities and the process of live organ harvesting. According to an investigation by the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong, over 100 different military hospitals have developed or expanded their organ transplant facilities, with over 2,000 398 medical personnel involved.29>3 These include military general hospitals which belong directly to the Central Military Commission, all military branch general hospitals, general hospitals which belong to the seven regional military commands, hospitals affiliated with military medical universities, military hospitals coded with numbers, and armed police general hospitals.

Just the Jilin Jiutai region, which has the fifth-largest secret detention facilities holding Falun Gong practitioners, detained more than 14,000 of them.\" According to this military doctor, who indicated that he has chosen to remain anonymous for his safety: the Chinese Communist Party Central Military Commission had documentation since 1962, and has followed through to today, that all death row and serious offenders can be treated according to the needs of national and socialist development and can be dealt with according to the revolutionary protocol. The seizure of organs from serious offenders was legalized by a supplementary regulation enacted in 1984. Many local public security departments deal with this either by directly 400 transplanting from these people and cremating them afterwards, or by wounding them, forming death rituals, directly transplanting, and then cremating. After 1992, with the rising costs of industrial raw materials as a result of the development of many industries, human bodies became a valuable raw material. Both living bodies and corpses became raw materials. At present, the Chinese Communist Party Central defines Falun Gong members as a class enemy. This means that there is no need to report if they are treated in line with the needs of economic development. In other words, like serious offenders, Falun Gong people are no longer seen as human beings, but raw materials for products, and they became a commodity. He wrote again to the Epoch Times in April 2006 to give more details of the process: Anyone targeted for organ transplantation would be taken away from prisons, forced labour camps, detention centres, secret camps, etc. At that point, their real name would be replaced with a code corresponding to a forged voluntary organs name ... the next step would be to undergo the live organ transplant ... this person is no longer seen as a human being, but an animal.

Prices for foreigners are not fixedin some cases, those with money, desperate for an organ, have been charged up to $2 million for a transplantation and hospital stay. Yangs other friend worked at the Ministry of Public Security and was in charge of informant stations of a major city on the coast of mainland China. During the New Year holidays in 2012, he told Yang that as far as he knew, over the past decade, at least 500,000 Falun Gong practitioners organs were harvested for transplants in civilian hospitals in China. This number did not include the portion from the hospitals affiliated with the armed police, military, and public security. The statistics of these hospitals were top secret and even the personnel in the Ministry of Public Security could not obtain them.264 Phone Calls Since Anne made her public statement about live organ harvesting in March 2006, the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong has documented more than 2,000 recorded phone interviews with members of the judiciary, military, armed police, and organ transplant centres in 31 provinces, municipalities directly under central government and autonomous regions. The targets of investigation include members of the Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party Central Military Commission, a CMC member and former defense minister, a former head of the Peoples Liberation Army General Logistics Department's Health Division, members of central and local Political and Legal Affairs Committees, agents of the 610 Office, transplant doctors in military and civilian hospitals all over China, and an organ broker.

PARTY POLICY AND TRANSPLANT VOLUME This is a story which begins in mystery and ends in mass murder. From where do all the organs for transplants come in China? China, for most of its transplant history, did not have a donation system at all. China now has a donation system which produces almost no donations, so that is not the answer. Because of the availability of organs with short waiting times and the absence of a law sourcing organs from brain dead cardiac alive patients, the answer is not accident victims. Because of disease in the prison population, the need for blood type compatibility, a law which requires execution seven days after the sentence, and the decreasing number of persons sentenced to death, the answer, for the most part, is not death penalty criminals. So what is the answer? The answer is mostly innocents, prisoners of conscience, Tibetans, Uyghurs, select House Christians and, most of all, Falun Gong practitioners. What is driving this mass murder? Is it the Chinese Communist Party and its abhorrence of Falun Gong? Or is it the demand for organs and needs of the health system, particularly the military hospitals, for funding? Did the Party lead the health system in these mass killings, or did the health system take advantage of a vulnerable population that the Party had made available for exploitation? The constitution of China refers to \"the Chinese people of all nationalities led by the Chinese Communist Party\" or under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party\" six different times. When something occurs in China as systematic and widespread and in such great numbers as the killing of Falun Gong for their organs, it is a denial of the reality of China to ascribe leadership to anything but the Chinese Communist Party. When the Chinese Communist Party issues an order that Falun Gong must be physically destroyed, as it has done, it is not too big a leap to conclude that the Communist Party has ordered that Falun Gong be physically destroyed through organ harvesting. This explanation concludes that the large-scale organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners was directly ordered by the Standing Committee of the Party and implemented by both military and civilian institutions. Through various levels of the 610 Office, the Party established a unified chain of operations to enable harvesting of organs on demand. The People's Liberation Army General Logistics Department has served as the core operations unit, with cooperation from other military units, armed police, Political and Legal Affairs Committee at different levels, the medical system, and organ brokers. Through this chain of operations, practitioners arrested when petitioning in Beijing and those detained across the country were forced to undergo blood tests and other medical examinations. The results were registered in a database of living organ sources to enable quick tissue matching for allocation. The Peoples Liberation Army General Logistics Department operates in a centralized and secretive mode, allocating detention facilities, distribution, transportation, delivery, security, and accounting of supplied organs.274 Under the direction of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, led by the military, organized and driven first by the Ministry of Health and later by its successor, the National Health and Family Planning Commission, China's transplant centres grew rapidly. 408 The alternative is that the Party passively acquiesced to mass killings led by the transplant profession and the hospitals in search of funding and, perversely, reputation, and by patients who did not care who was killed as long as they could live. Greed, selfishness and institutional demands drove the health system to pillage the organs of a marginalized, dehumanized minority. The large sums patients paid for organs went not just to medical personnel and hospitals, but also, in part, to prison, labour camp and detention centre guards who handed over Falun Gong detainees. Corruption has become pervasive in China, and the killing of Falun Gong for their organs is one aspect of it. The massive organ supply available from Falun Gong practitioners was, to hospitals and transplant professionals, an opportunity. Hospitals grasped the opportunity. They innovated continuously in transplant capabilities and technology. The innovations became standardized and shared among the hospitals. Within a few years, liver and kidney transplants became routine clinical surgery. Organ transplantation techniques and volume increased rapidly. National level transplant centres popularized their clinical technology throughout the country, trained a large number of transplant doctors, and led the exponential growth of China's transplant industry. A third explanation is a synthesis of the previous two. The Communist Partys demonization and brutalization of Falun Gong and the health system's insatiable demand for organs have lived in China in symbiosis. Each feeds off the other. The combination is a human rights and humanitarian disaster. Before 2000, the technology in kidney and liver transplants had matured through the sourcing of organs from prisoners sentenced to death and prisoners of conscience. The repression of Falun Gong opened up a mass organ supply. If the Chinese Communist Party had not approved and supported the mass killing of Falun Gong for their organs, it would not have been possible for the transplant profession and the hospitals to participate in and benefit from these killings. Unless transplant professionals and hospitals were motivated for their own reasons to transplant organs without regard to their source, a Party-driven policy of killing Falun Gong for their organs would have not gone very far. As noted earlier incentives to growth in transplant volume are supported by the Partys national strategic planning. Since 2001, the Party has incorporated organ transplantation into its Five-Year Plans. In an interview with Phoenix TV on January 11, 2015,2973 former Deputy Health Minister Huang Jiefu was asked these questions and gave these answers: Reporter: Minister Huang, have you ever taken organs from executed prisoners? Huang: | said went there once, but was not the one who did the extraction.", "tokens": 1278, "label": "heavy"}

Reporter: Do you remember which year it was? Huang: 1994. Reporter: Was that the first year you did a human organ transplant? Huang: First year. Because organ transplant is divided into two teams. One is the organ team, who extracts the organs. One is the recipient team, who transplants the organs. Reporter: You? 409 Huang: | am in the recipient team. I've never been in the organ team. But I did go once to see how they do it. So, I have only been there once. After that time, I never wanted to have anything to do with the organ team. But I feel that I needed to change it. Reporter: When you help the recipient, you think it is saving a life. But do you try not to think about the \"organ\"? Huang: The majority of the transplant surgeons feel helpless. On the one hand, you face the patient who has a failing organ. As a doctor, you have the ability and responsibility to save people. But the other side of the story, when you think about the organ source, you feel helpless. In criminal law, the term for this behavior is willful blindness. A person who commits a criminal act and is willfully blind is as guilty of a crime as a person who commits the act with full knowledge. Huang said that he felt helpless.", "tokens": 264, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "However, he was not helpless. He could have said \"no\" to participating in organ transplantation using an organ from an improper source. If Huang truly \"never wanted to have anything to do with the organ team,\" then he could have stopped performing transplants. The notion that he has nothing to do with the organ team, when he is taking organs from the organ team, is a fantasy. If organ harvesting goes against the moral bottom line of a doctor, and in this case Huang stated that it did, then using an organ from an improper source also goes against the moral bottom line of the doctor. There is no difference in the morality of harvesting from an improper source and transplanting an organ harvested from a source which the transplanting doctor knows to be improper or to which the transplanting doctor is willfully blind. Health workers went along. The detailed testimony of the Uyghur surgeon, Dr. Enver Tohti, tells us there were professional consequences for not going along. There were lucrative benefits for cooperating. Some rationalized their behavior by claiming that they were changing the system from within. Live organ transplants from prisoners of conscience have been taking place since at least 1997. Live organ transplants of scale, and thus, from Falun Gong practitioners, have been taking place for 16 years, and counting. Although a few kingpins of harvesting such as Bo Xilai, Wang Lijun and Zhou Yongkang were arrested and jailed (using pretexts and not organ harvesting,) the reform never came. And that is a tragedy for the Chinese people. The Chinese transplant system needs to be reformed. However, such reform is difficult in its current contextan autocratic Communist state in which the abuse and torture of enemies of the state is accepted practice. Stopping the persecution of Falun Gong and other prisoners of conscience, ending the sourcing of transplants from prisoners of conscience, and bringing to justice the perpetrators of organ transplant abuse would mean changing the nature of the Chinese Communist Party. Expecting an organ transplant island of transparency and rule of law in a raging sea of tyranny, repression, cover-up, and incitement is delusional. Yet there may be a reckoning. Perhaps the Chinese people will have the opportunity judge its former leadership and its medical establishment. Once the reckoning begins, the road to justice will be lined with families, Han Chinese, Uyghurs and Tibetan, who have lost someone. China has been one of the great cradles of medical innovation, a land where solutions to problems that we think of as novel and modern, developed and thrived. As a singularly great culture, China is second to none in its ingenuity, and, over thousands of years of civilization, it was second to none in its attention to ethics. Today, that ethical spirit may be suppressed and appear to be sleeping, but the ethics and the ethical are still there. Many Chinese people aspire 410 to moral principles. In restoring the ethical and moral baseline, there is no better place to start for both the Chinese and the international community alike than stopping the Chinese organ harvesting juggernaut. 411 Closing Comments lI. RECOMMENDATIONS An Investigation The official Chinese claim of 10,000 transplants a year, with some years higher, bring the official total transplant volume to date to 150,000 to 200,000 transplants since the persecution of Falun Gong began. This number far exceeds all NGO estimates of death penalty numbers. There is no other plausible explanation for the sourcing of this number of organs than the killing of Falun Gong (and to a lesser extent, the killing of Uyghurs, Tibetans and House Christians) for their organs. Our update shows that the actual number of transplants is far larger than the official figures, in the order of hundreds of thousands larger. Given the systematic efforts at cover up, it is impossible to affix an exact number to transplant volumes. We can state with some confidence that complete innocents, practitioners of a set of exercises with a spiritual foundation, a Chinese form of yoga, have been victims of mass killing for their organs. We can say further that this slaughter has been led by the Chinese Communist Party. Ultimately, it does not fall to us to explain where China gets it organs for transplants. The duty to explain the sourcing of organs for transplantation falls on China. The United Nations rapporteurs on torture and religious intolerance asked in the years 2007 and 2008 for the Government of China to account for the large discrepancy between the volumes of transplants they claimed to have made and the volume of sources they were prepared to acknowledge.2974 The Government of China answered these queries in 2007 with silence, in 2008 with propaganda, and in 2015 with fiction. The World Health Organization Guiding Principle 1 of the Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation requires consent from the donor to organ removal for the purpose of transplantation. Guiding Principle 10 requires traceability of organ transplants. Guiding principle 11 requires that donation activities be transparent and open to scrutiny.297 The European Parliament passed a resolution in December 2013 on organ harvesting in China. That resolution, amongst other provisions, called for a full and transparent investigation by the European Union into organ transplant practices in China.297 That resolution did not specify which component of the European Union was to do the investigation. But the logical component is the European Parliament itself. The relevant procedure for the Parliament would be the establishment of a special temporary committee to conduct the investigation and produce the report.", "tokens": 928, "label": "heavy"}

The Committee against Torture recommended in 2008 that \"The State party should immediately conduct or commission an independent investigation of the claims that some Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to torture and used for organ transplants and take measures, as 412 appropriate, to ensure that those responsible for such abuses are prosecuted and punished.\"978 In the intervening seven years, the Government of China has neither conducted nor commissioned any such independent investigation. The Committee in 2015 reiterated this recommendation stating: \"The State party [China] should also commission an independent investigation to look into claims that some Falun Gong practitioners may have been subjected to this practice [removal of organs without consent].\" What can one realistically do in this situation?

Edmund Morel asked, how were the ivory and rubber which were shipped to Belgium being purchased in the Congo? The answer, he concluded in research published first in 1901, was that they were not; the people producing the ivory and rubber were not being paid. They were slaves.

Casement travelled throughout the Congo for three months and came back with a report which established the existence of slavery in the Congo beyond shadow of a doubt, despite, it should be said, the continuing denials of King Leopold of Belgium. Where does this leave us today? There is as much of a discrepancy today between the volume of transplants in China and sources of organs the Government of China is prepared to admit - death penalty prisoners and voluntary organs - as there was in the early twentieth century between the commercial value of goods being shipped into the Congo and the commercial value of goods being shipped back to Belgium.

What needs to be done today is what those concerned about Slavery did after the publication of the Morel research and before the Casement report - demand accountability and call for an investigation. The predecessor to the UN Human Rights Council, the Human Rights Commission, used to see presented, if not adopted, resolutions about the human rights situation in China. The Chinese government negotiated these resolutions away, offering bilateral human rights dialogue in exchange for abandonment of resolution proposals on human rights in China. All the proponents of the resolutions accepted this devil's bargain and the dialogues have now existed for many years. Canadian academic Charles Burton evaluated in April 2006 the Canada China bilateral dialogue at the request of the Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He reported that Chinese participants in the dialogues were low level officials who spent much of the time of the meetings just reading scripts, and what is more, the same scripts year after year. There was no obvious connection between these dialogues and what actually happened in China. Senior Chinese Communist officials resisted taking the dialogue 413 seriously; they saw it as an affront to China's national dignity for China to be made to answer to foreigners for domestic policy decisions.27? Katrin Kinzelbach reached a similar conclusion for the European Union China human rights dialogue.2989 She\nwrites: \"Over the years, [Chinese officials] had become human rights dialogue professionals... [T]he regular confidential talks behind closed doors had served as intensive training for a small number of Chinese officials on how to engage with - and effectively counter - human rights related inquiries, criticism and recommendations.\" The futility of this dialogue is underlined by the Falun Gong experience. Many foreign affairs officials in various governments with whom we have spoken over the years indicate that they regularly raise the persecution of Falun Gong in these dialogues to no avail. They report that their Chinese counterparts are either unresponsive or rude. The persecution of Falun Gong, as a result of these dialogues, has not lessened one bit. The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and all other countries should pull out of these dialogues and return the issue of human rights violations in China to the UN Human Rights Council. Asking the Chinese Communist Party to investigate itself is a fools game. Instead the Western countries should ask the UN system to do the investigation. An example of an effective investigative effort can be found in the initiative to determine what had happened during the ending years of the civil war in Sri Lanka, from February 2002 to May 2009. The Government of Sri Lanka in November 2011 produced a report on this period which was, perhaps unsurprisingly, a whitewash of those in power. The United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2013 passed a resolution, led by the United States, asking Sri Lanka to conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law during the ending years of the civil war. When the Government of Sri Lanka did not do this, the Council in March 2014, again in a resolution led by the US, asked the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights to conduct the investigation the Government of Sri Lanka did not do. The resolution asked the Office to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the ending years of the civil war.

Yet medical privacy is necessarily elastic; in many jurisdictions, medical privacy ends when there is a gunshot wound involved. Why then do medical authorities across the world adhere to strict medical privacy when there is an organ sourced in China? Is not the potential crime heinous enough? In fact, there are only two places where one can receive the full range of organs from a prisoner of conscience: China and more recently, the territory under the control of the Islamic State, commonly known as ISIS. The 414 patients who return with new organs are dependent on anti-rejection drugs; so why is it that surgeons and the state cannot even make a proper estimate of who is exploiting these services? This is an obscenity; for an outsider to go to China-or to ISIS controlled territory-to receive an organ may be to participate in an ongoing crime against humanity. The medical community needs to be at the barricades, stopping that participation, working with government officials and medical stakeholders to make exceptions to the strict privacy requirements. States, in turn, can play a critical role in stopping the Chinese harvesting juggernaut simply by limiting supply. Until the Chinese State offers the full and comprehensive accounting that the world demands, states should follow the example of Israel, Spain and now, just recently, Taiwan and ban organ tourism to ISIS controlled territory and China. Finally, the work of promotion of respect for human rights is not solely or even primarily the work of governments. It is the work of individuals everywhere, those to whom human rights belong.

We urge them to do so, anonymously if necessary, by contacting ChinaOrganHarvest.org in either Chinese or English, Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, or EndOrganPillaging.org in English. Contact and Collaboration A way into the labyrinth of Chinese organ transplant abuse is policies opposing contact and collaboration with Chinese transplant professionals who perpetrate the abuse. The Transplantation Society developed such a policy, directed specifically to China, dated November 2006. The Society said about the presentation of transplant studies from China at Transplantation Society meetings: presentations of studies involving patient data or samples from recipients of organs or tissues from executed prisoners should not be accepted.\" The November 2006 treated collaboration on studies the same way. It stated: \"Collaboration with experimental studies should only be considered if no material derived from executed prisoners or recipients of organs or tissues from executed prisoners is used in the studies. The Societys policy was to permit doctors from China to become members of the Society only if they \"sign the Statement of The Transplantation Society for Membership agreeing to conduct clinical practice according to The Transplantation Society policy.\" When it came to clinical or pre-clinical trainees from transplant programs that use organs or tissues from executed prisoners, the policy stated that \"Care should be taken to ensure, as far as possible, that it is their intention that their clinical career will comply with the standards of practice outlined in The Transplantation Society Policy & Ethics Statement. 415 Ostracism has been a vehicle for change in China. The China Medical Tribune reported the refusal to allow 35 Chinese participants for ethical reasons to attend the World Transplant Congress in San Francisco in July 2014.298! It also noted that for the most recent Hangzhou, China transplant conference that \"many overseas transplant experts failed to attend.\" A year before, in October 2013, the China Transplant Congress, also held in Hangzhou, had an abundance of foreign expert attendees.

Doctors Danovitch, Shapiro, and Lavee, in a 2011 article, wrote \"Training of Chinese transplant professionals by the international community must be conditioned on commitments that trainees will not engage, directly or indirectly, in the use of organs from executed prisoners.\"2984 Yet, another form of avoiding complicity is refusal to publish research of Chinese transplant professionals using data garnered from organ transplant abuse. The Editors and Associate Editors of the journal Liver Transplantation, wrote in 2007 that they have decided that original publications dealing with clinical liver transplantation outcomes submitted to this journal should explicitly exclude the use of executed prisoners or paid organs as a source of organs.\"2983 The American Journal of Transplantation issued as instructions to authors a new policy effective May 2011 which States: \"AJT will not accept manuscripts whose data derives from transplants involving organs obtained from executed prisoners. Manuscripts writing about this practice (e.g. an editorial or a report recounting the secondary consequences of this practice) may be considered at the discretion of the Editorial Board, but require a written appeal to the Board prior to submission of the manuscript.\" Danovitch, M.E.", "tokens": 244, "label": "medium"}

Many attendees to the 2014 Hangzhou conference were likely asking where all the overseas transplant experts were. Those doctors who applied to attend and participate in the World Transplant Congress in San Francisco in July 2014 and were rejected, and their colleagues who knew they were applying to attend, also needed an explanation. The Communist Party may have felt that they could ignore the evidence of the killing of Falun Gong, Uyghurs and Tibetans for their organs. However, they could not ignore the fact that Chinese transplant doctors were denied admission to an international transplant congress or that foreign transplant doctors who had come before to China were no longer coming. In response to this ostracism, the Party made no substantive changes but did make a wide variety of contradictory statements about how the situation either is better now or would get better in the future. David Matas set out these statements, at length, in a talk he gave in April 2015 in Bern, Switzerland to the International Society of Human Rights.284 The bottom line driving all the remarks was a desire to end the ostracism. The peer pressure of the international profession, at the very least, got the attention of Chinese authorities in a way that no other initiative had. The criteria for reconnection between the Chinese and international transplant community should be: 1) anadmission of past wrongdoing, including full disclosure of the sourcing of organ transplants in the past; 2) acommitment to bring to justice all perpetrators of past organ transplant abuse and commencement of proceedings; 3) expulsion from the Chinese Medical Association of transplant professionals who cannot establish beyond a reasonable doubt that their sourcing of organs is proper; 4) cooperation with an international investigation into present and past sourcing of organs for transplant; 5) publication of present and past death penalty statistics; 6) public access to the past and present aggregates of the four Chinese transplant registries - lung, liver, heart and kidney;\n7) full, independently verifiable transparency of current sourcing of organs for transplant; 8) establishment of a system of traceability of sources for transplants and use of that system; 9) cooperation with an outside, independent verification system for compliance with international standards; and 10) repeal of the 1984 law which allows for organ sourcing from prisoners without either their consent or the consent of their families. 417 Il. CONCLUSIONS This update draws these conclusions: 418 Organ transplantation volume in China is far larger than official Chinese government statistics indicate; The source for most of the massive volume of organs for transplants is the killing of innocents: Uyghurs, Tibetans, House Christians and primarily, practitioners of the spiritually based set of exercises Falun Gong; Organ pillaging in China is a crime in which the Communist Party, State institutions, the health system, hospitals and the transplant profession are all complicit; The global intergovernmental community should establish an institution-based, independent investigation into organ transplant abuse in China; The global transplant community should connect and collaborate with the Chinese transplant community only if and when set criteria are met; Organ tourism to China should not be shielded by medical confidentiality, but openly monitored; No nation should allow their citizens to go to China for organs until China has allowed a full investigation into the organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience, both past and present.

One is to alert the reader that we have removed several typographical errors from the posted text. Because there is no impact on content, we have gone ahead and changed our update, as posted on the internet, to incorporate these corrections without indicating change by change what the corrections are. Readers, we are confident, are not that interested in reading about the typographical errors we have made and would be happy just to have a text without them. Detail Second, though the text has a wealth of detail, here we want to add even more. The purpose is to forestall quibbling over technicalities. 1) The difference between regional and national hospitals The labelling of hospitals as regional or national is our own. The Government of China does not describe its hospitals in this way. Some of its hospitals have the word \"national\" in the name. Our", "tokens": 162, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "list of national hospitals is not limited to those which describe themselves as national. We used the approved and designated lists published by the Ministry of Health in 2007.", "tokens": 29, "label": "light"}
{"text": "From those lists, we grouped together the first and second tier of transplant centres. We then, in the chapter \"Exploring Total Transplant Volume\", tabulated transplant capacities for the hospitals in that group. The first tier was the 89 transplant centres selected from over 1,000 candidates and approved by the Review Expert Team of the Human Organ Transplantation Skills Clinical Application Committee, 435 authorized by the Ministry of Health. We referred to these 89 as \"national level hospitals. The second tier contained 75 hospitals designated to perform organ transplants, which were issued 18-month temporary permits. We referred to these as \"regional level hospitals\". Their permits were to be reviewed in 2009, but the review was postponed to 2010. During this period, these hospitals continued to perform transplants. In 2010, 69 of the 75 designated hospitals received permanent approval. 6 were not renewed. However, 6 other transplant centres which were not in the 2007 list also received approval in 2010, suggesting that hospitals not given approval or permits in 2007 had also been carrying out organ transplants after 2007. As of 2010, a total of 164 hospitals were approved to conduct organ transplants. On August 8, 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (successor to the Ministry of Health) published a list of 165 hospitals approved to conduct organ transplants, including Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital Human Organ Transplant Centre, which performs transplants from donations after cardiac death (DCD). Four more DCD transplant hospitals were added to the list by the beginning of 2014, bringing the number of approved hospitals to 169. 2) Sun Yat-Sen University\nThe Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University was listed twice in the Ministry of Health's 2007 list - once for kidney transplants and another time for liver. If we count this as one hospital, the number of national transplant centres would be 88 instead of 89, and the total number of approved transplant centres would be 163 instead of 164 hospitals. Since the Ministry itself used the 164 number, we kept it ourselves, even though, objectively, it is a double counting. 3) Included military hospitals On page 17 of the update, we wrote, \"The Ministry of Health on May 23, 2007 announced a list of 87 transplant hospitals ...\" The Ministry of Health described the same hospitals differently in 436 2007 and 2010. The 2007 list contained the People's Liberation Army General Hospital (the People's Liberation Army Hospital 301) along with its clinical divisions. The 2010 list set out two of the clinical divisions separately as People's Liberation Army Hospital 309 and People's Liberation Army Hospital 304. The count for the 2007 list of hospitals, using the 2010 description of those hospitals, is 89, not 87. We also referred to \"temporary permits to 77 designated transplant centres with weaker qualifications\". These are the regional transplant centres. We arrived at the figure of 77 transplant centres by subtracting the number of national transplant centres, 87, from the total of approved hospitals 164. If we shift to 89 for the number of national transplant centres, the figure for designated regional transplant centres becomes 75. 4) Additional military hospitals\nWe stated at page 18 of our update: \"This report focuses on the 164 hospitals which received approval from the Ministry of Health in 2007, so that we can categorize their qualifications as either national or regional level. If we exclude the 18 heart and lung transplant centres, 146 transplant centres remain. These included 23 national-level military and armed police hospitals that were among the first batch approved in 2007.\" We arrived at the figure of 23 by tabulating hospitals with military and armed police names. However, some hospitals with civilian names were and are, nonetheless, military institutions. That is true of the Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University and Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, allocated to the Guangdong provincial government in August 2004. That is also true of the Wuhan General Hospital, which belongs to the Guangzhou Military Command. 5) Additional regional hospitals 437 As indicated, we based our labelling of hospitals as national or regional on the Government of China list on which they were found. We were working from three different Government of China hospital lists, from 2007, 2010 and 2013. We labelled all hospitals in the 2007 approved list as national and all hospitals in the 2010 designated list as regional.

As a Class 2 hospital, it should instead be classified under the category of \"161 Medium-Scale and Alternative Transplant Centres.\" 8) Death penalty numbers The text at page 385 states: Although the figures by different organizations with different methodologies varied, their conclusions and time trends are similarthe actual figure of the prisoners executed is believed to be much higher than China's official data, and the overall average figure of the prisoners sentenced to death before 1999 remains consistent with that after 1999, when the persecution of Falun Gong began. The reference to official data here is meant to refer to the total of the publicly available reports of individual executions. China, as noted, does not publish aggregate death penalty statistics. As well, the phrase \"death before 1999 remains consistent with that after 1999\" should instead 439 be \"death after 1999 remains similar to or lower than that before 1999\". The second formula- tion addresses more exactly the position we intended to take. Death penalty executions did not go up after 1999 and could not explain the increase of transplant volume. But death penalty executions did go down after 1999, making the official death penalty executions explanation for transplant volumes increasingly implausible.

We should have stated The General Surgery department has over 170 open beds.

In the introduction to Chapter 5 (page 166), we wrote, \"This category includes 20 armed forces and 48 civilian transplant centres\" and \"A full summary of the 68 hospitals ...\" As may have been apparent, we point out that these 68 hospitals are liver and/or kidney transplant centres; in total there are 75 regional-level transplant centres. 2) At page 218 we wrote: \"In 1993, he received further training in kidney transplantation at the Xingiao hospital of the People's Liberation Army the website stated that Wang has experience in managing more than 1,400 kidney transplants. in that case, why is his 2016 total 400 fewer than that of 2014?\" 440 The punctuation first of all needs correcting.

Upon inspecting the patients body cavity, Huang found that an autologous transplant would be suitable. This was a much reported event in China and the reports are, in their detail, not consistent. We have made more of an effort since the Update was released to determine which of these reports is more accurate. We would now describe this event this way: There, Huang Jiefu performed an autologous liver transplantation for a male patient, at The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. He first planned to conduct a bile duct cancer surgery but, upon inspecting the patient's body cavity, Huang found that an autologous transplant would be suitable. 4) In Chapter 11, at page 381, we wrote: \"The corpses used in the body exhibits had been plastinated within two days of death.\" The endnote in support is numbered 1956 *. A literal translation of the endnote text is \"fresh corpses\" instead of \"within two days of death.\" We chose 441 to write \"within two days of death\" because that is the outer limitation of freshness for organs for a dead person. 7! 5) At page 392, we wrote: \"There were also 300 forced labour camps before the laogai system was abolished at the end of 2013.\" This instance of \"laogai\" should instead be \"laojiao,\" which refers to labour camps only.

Huang Jiefu has said that the change occurred \"in just a few years\" or in just six to seven years\", 762 Additional findings A fourth purpose of this addendum is to inform the reader of additional, corroborative, findings we have made since the update was written. 1) For the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen Hospital in Chapter 4 on page 70, we wish to add that in 1998, the hospital's transplant surgery department was formed through the merger of its former abdominal transplant surgery department and former urologic surgery department's kidney transplant group. Huang Jiefu was the director of the transplant department before becoming Vice Minister of Health in November 2001.

The department had previously performed heart\ntransplants for two patients simultaneously in July 2009. 443 The same afternoon, the hospital's vice president Hu Yu gave the order to perform four heart transplants simultaneously and mobilized personnel in primarily the cardiac surgery department but also in the anaesthesiology, operating rooms, ICU, blood centre, and nursing departments. More than 200 medical personnel, including 13 professors and 17 associate professors from the cardiac surgery department, split into four teams, each of which independently completed donor selection, procurement, matching, and transplantation. On June 21 at 10:43, four hearts were simultaneously transported to operating rooms at Union Hospital. At 11:50, led by Professor Dong Nianguo, director of the cardiac surgery department, four specialist teams began performing four heart transplants at the same time. In the 22 minutes between 13:47 and 14:09, the four hearts were beating again in four end-stage heart disease patients. On June 24, the Wuhan Union Hospital Cardiac Surgery Department announced that these four transplant surgeries were successful and had set a national record. 4) In addition to the types of transplants mentioned on page 277 of the update, we have found complete transplant price lists published on some hospitals websites. These lists include a full range of organ, tissue, and cell transplants. One can see that many types of transplants have become routine procedures. The surgery fees are set at extremely low levels. We give two examples. The fees charged are per operation, covering only the transplant surgery (doctors' fee) and exclude organ and procurement costs. The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University published a notice titled Chongqing City Medical Service Prices (Trial),\" issued by the Chongqing Pricing Bureau and the Chongqing Health Bureau on March 26, 2004.

On occasion also, our translators committed translation errors. 1) At page 348, we wrote \"On October 10, 2011, the Central Propaganda Ministry, the Ministry of Health ...\" This date should instead be May 10, 2011. The error occurred when transcribing from the source. 2) At page 254, we wrote that \"the total transplant volume of many medium and small transplant institutions comprised 80% of the total in China. The large transplant centres made up the other 20%\" We should instead have stated, \"medium and small transplant institutions made up 80% 44.7 of the total number of transplant centres and produced about half of all transplants in China.\"\n3) At page 272, we stated that No. 474 Hospital of Lanzhou Military Command could carry out 12 kidney transplants at once. A direct translation of the source shows that it can perform \"12 kidney transplants consecutively at once.\" While that wording does not explicitly state that the transplants are performed simultaneously, it still validates the centre's significant transplant Capacity. 4) At page 372, we listed 53 transplants reported in a medical journal for Jintan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Jiangsu.

We have, accordingly, provided a glossary.\" On reflection, we decided that the provision of a glossary is superfluous. While we do not expect every reader to be familiar with every medical term used in the update, there are excellent medical dictionaries online. We refer the reader to any one of these online medical dictionaries for medical terms with which the reader is not familiar. For instance, there is this _ link: //medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com Endnotes We checked the endnotes to make sure the links worked. In some cases, they did not. So we corrected the links to ensure that they did work. We also moved some endnote placements in the text, so that the endnotes more directly linked to the text for which references were given. Our translators went over the endnote translations and, in some cases, replaced them with better 448 translations. We also added some endnotes to make the references more complete.

So, for instance, the first table in chapter nine, which followed the first figure, was table 9.2 and not table 9.1.

{"text": "Our base case remains that China and the US will resume negotiation after the G20 Summit (no Turther escalation) and reach some sort of a trade deal later this year. If we are wrong, the US could impose additional 25% tariffs on the rest of the Chinese exports to the US (about $270 bn) as soon as July. In addition, the US would proceed with restricting exports to Huawei, disrupting its production and the global tech supply chain. China's responses will likely be limited and include raising tariffs further on US products and retaliate against those companies that halted supplies to China for \"non- commercial\" reasons. The additional drag on GDP growth could be over 120 bps We estimate that additional 25% tariffs on $270bn will be another >80 bps drag on China's GDP growth over a 12 month period, mainly through weaker exports and associated multiplier effect on consumption and investment, with Q3 and Q4 likely hit the hardest. The impact of the restrictions on Huawei is harder to quantify, but it can be another >40 bps over the next few quarters. We thus expect Chinese exports to fall by 8% and 9% in 2019E and 2020E in the worse case scenario, and imports to decline by 6.5% and 8%, respectively. Expect more monetary and fiscal easing, but no major property stimulus In the case of further trade war escalation, we expect the PBC to increase liquidity offering, cut RRR by >200bps (and more in 2020) and lower benchmark lending interest rates by 50bps in 2019E. These could help boost overall credit growth to 13% at end-2019 and 2020. Additional fiscal easing may focus more on infrastructure investment, employment/social welfare support and consumption. We dont see a major property stimulus but do expect local governments to relax existing restrictions, banks to improve mortgage access, and shanty-town renovation target to be raised. We also expect the government to expand market opening and speed up SOE reforms. Weaker growth but no sharp RMB depreciation\nWe expect additional policy easing to partially offset the negative impact of more tariffs and tech restrictions and help stabilize growth at 5.8% in 2019E and 5.5% in 2020E. Nominal GDP and corporate earnings would likely drop more as China's PPI contracts. A larger current account deficit and more monetary easing will likely put more depreciation pressure on the RMB, but we expect the government to tightly manage the currency with the help of its fixing strategy, tight controls on capital outtlows, and policy measures to stabilize growth.

{"text": "What might further escalation look like? The risk of further trade war escalation is still lingering despite a scheduled Xi-Trump meeting at G20. Our base case forecast assumes that the US and China will reach some sort of a trade deal so that no additional US tariffs will be imposed on Chinese exports, and that some existing tariffs may be rolled back gradually. In this case, the recent hike of US tariffs on the $200 bn Chinese exports trom 10% to 25% can be somewhat offset by a modest additional policy easing and China's GDP growth will remain above 6% this year. However, the US administration is proceeding with plans to impose additional tariffs on the rest of Chinese exports after the recent tariff hike, and has put China's tech giant Huawel on the entity list\", which constituted a de-facto export ban. Meanwhile, China issued a White Paper accusing the US side of reneging in trade talks and encroaching on China's sovereignty. Until recently, the rhetoric on both sides has Started to soften at margins, as Presidents Xi and Trump agreed to meet at G20 in late June. That said, the risk of further trade war escalation is still lingering, given remaining gaps in US and Chinese positions and some fundamental Issues. Therefore, we consider how our forecast would change in case of further trade war escalation. Further escalation entails more tariffs and tech restrictions on China, while China's retaliation may be limited. In this worse case scenario, there is no trade deal between the US and China in the near future, and the US imposes additional 25% tariffs on the rest of Chinese exports to the US (about $270 bn) sometime in July. In addition, the US proceeds with restricting exports to Huawei (and more Chinese tech firms). As a response, China raises tariffs on most US exports to China to 25%, which in essence mean the average 18% additional tariffs on $60 bn of US products will go up to 25%, and suspended additional auto tariffs on the US go up by 25% (i.e. from 15% to 40%). China's response will be limited as most US exports to China are already subject to higher tariffs. The de-facto export ban on Huawei will significantly hurt Huawel's production capabilities and disrupt the global tech supply chain. China has announced a plan for an unreliable entity list\", Supposedly targeting entities that cut off supplies to China for \"non- commercial\" reasons. We think this is meant as a deterrent/retaliation to those who cut supplies to China, not meant to target US companies operating in China or US consumer brands in general. Indeed China has been pushing tor more measures to attract/keep more FDI. Estimating the tariff impact\nAdditional tariff hikes and tech restrictions will likely lower China's GDP growth by a further >120 bps. We estimate that additional 25% tariffs on $270 bn will be another >80 bps drag on GDP growth over a 12 month period, not taking into account the impact due to negative sentiment or second round effect through weaker global growth. The 80 bps negative impact will mainly come from weaker exports and associated multiplier effect on consumption and corporate investment. The impact of export restrictions to Huawei is harder to quantity given its extensive supply chain linkages, but it can be >40 bps on GDP growth over the next few quarters. The biggest hit from higher tariffs will likely occur in Q3 and Q4 when front loading has ended; the impact from tech restrictions has already started, but likely peak later in Q4 and Q1 next year when related orders and capex are hit (Figure 1). Macro Keys 25 June 2019 a UBS 2\nBoth China's exports and imports are likely to contract sharply should trade war escalate further. In the first 4 months of this year, US data show that total imports from China declined by 12.8% y/y while those on the tariff lists (25% on $50 bn and 10% on $200 bn) contracted by 30% y/y (Figure 2). While the current tariff lists target mainly intermediate goods, the next $270 billion include mostly consumer goods such as electronics and garments, which arguably have higher elasticity (i.e, demand may fall more with higher tariffs). In addition, exports to the rest of the world will likely be hurt by increased uncertainties and restricted access to intermediate components. We thus expect Chinese exports to fall by 8% in 2019E and 9% in 2020E, in USD terms. On the imports side, processing components related to exports will decline along with exports to the US, imports tor domestic capex and consumption will likely weaken, and while imports of commodities and materials may be supported by domestic stimulus, import prices will likely tall due to generally weaker demand. As such, we expect overall imports to fall by 6.5% in 2019E and 8% in 2020E. Even so, we expect China to run a current account deficit of roughly $48bn (0.3% of GDP) this year and $116bn (0.8% of GDP) next.

As the PBC and other officials have stated, China still has policy room and Is ready to use them. In the case of a full-blown trade war, we expect the PBC to cut RRR by at least 200 bps this year, 100 bps in Q3 tollowing the tariff hike, and 100 bps in Q4 (Figure 3). In addition, liquidity may be injected through other facilities such as the MLF. The likely further drop in US interest rates and expected Fed rate cuts (on top of the recent decline, see Q series) will also give China more room to cut benchmark interest rates we expect 50 bps cut in benchmark lending rate and 25 bps cut in deposit rate this year in the worse case scenario, likely in Q3 (Figure 4). 10-year CGB and money market rates will also likely drop by 40-50bps by year end. These measures can help boost adjusted TSF credit growth to accelerate to 13% (13.5% in official TSF) this year and in 2020 (Figure 5-6).

Additional fiscal easing may focus more on infrastructure investment and employment/social welfare support. So far this year, the government's fiscal easing has focused more on tax cuts, which is positive for corporate balance sheets but not very effective in stimulating investment when firms worry about orders. We think infrastructure investment will receive a bigger push next should trade war escalate (Figure 7). Already, we have seen signs that the government is preparing more infrastructure projects and financing channels. The latest circular on special local government bonds (a portion of which can be used as equity for qualified infrastructure projects to leverage up more funding) is a good example. In addition, as trade war escalation may lead to significant job losses, we expect the government to expand vocational training (including tor migrant workers), increase employment subsidies and provide more unemployment support to help cushion the blow. More specific measures to support consumption may also be rolled out.", "tokens": 480, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "Property policies will likely be relaxed but no major property stimulus. Further trade war escalation will likely have a negative impact on the property sector through weakening the labor market and sentiment, but liquidity and credit Macro Keys 25 June 2019 & UBS 4\neasing will likely indirectly benetit the property sector, as we have seen in March- April 2019. Moreover, we would expect the authorities, especially local governments in higher tier cities, to relax existing property restrictions, banks make more credit available to mortgages and related property borrowing, and a bigger effort in shanty town renovation this year's shanty town target may be revised up later in the year. Hukou relaxations may be accelerated in medium and large cities as well. That said, we do not see a major property stimulus in the form of large- scale subsidies (as in 2016-17) and significant cut in down payment requirement nationwide given concerns about China's high debt level and property prices. We think the moderate relaxation should help stabilize property market and sustain property investment until perhaps H2 2020. More opening and SOE reforms. While the desire to manage China's financial risk and avoid a big property bubble will limit the size of stimulus, we think the authorities may accelerate market opening and reform in case of trade war escalation. Facing supply chain disruptions and shifts, we believe China will redouble its effort to attract foreign investment by opening more manufacturing and services sectors tor FDI and opening domestic financial markets turther to global investors. More significant SOE divestment and SOE reform can help boost private sector confidence, along with measures to ease credit access and tax cuts.

In a full-blown trade war scenario, we expect net exports to subtract 1.3ppts from GDP growth in 2019E and another 0.9 ppts in 2020E. Weaker profitability and trade war uncertainties will likely hamper manufacturing capex further, leading to a contraction in manufacturing FAI (see China CFO survey). However, we expect policy stimulus to help stabilize property and services investment and boost infrastructure investment, resulting in a stronger fixed investment growth than in our baseline forecast. On consumption, the downward pressure from job losses and slower wage growth should be partially offset by specific measures to support consumption, strengthen social safety net, and hukou reform. Macro Keys 25 June 2019 UBS 5\nCorporate earnings are expected to drop as PPI weaken.

{"text": "CPI inflation should Stay in positive territory partly helped by elevated pork and food prices.

{"text": "In addition, as many companies respond to higher tariffs by cutting prices (see CFO survey), their profit margins will be squeezed. Weaker RMB but no sharp depreciation. As China's exports drop and external balance worsens, we expect the RMB to face increased depreciation pressure, which will likely be amplified by macro policy easing. Nevertheless, the Chinese government will unlikely allow for a sharp RMB depreciation for fear that it would lead to destabilizing outflows and more depreciation. With the help of its fixing strategy and tight controls on capital outtlows, we forecast USDCNY to depreciate modestly to 7.2 in 2019 and 7.3 in 2020 in the case of a full-blown trade war. The PBC's issuance of CNH notes can help mop up liquidity offshore and manage the exchange rate as well. Property market and policy may be the biggest risk to our forecasts. We expect the government to relax property policies further in the worse case scenario without resorting to a major property stimulus. However, given the importance of the property sector and that many government officials focus more on short-term growth than medium-term sustainability, there is a significant risk of a bigger property easing, helped and/or accompanied by a larger credit expansion. In such a case, TSF credit and GDP growth may be higher than our forecasts, China's imports (especially of commodities) may be stronger, current account deficit may be larger, and investor worries on the RMB and financial sector stability will also be greater. On the other hand, if the government decides not to stimulate as much tor reasons of medium-term sustainability and continues to manage local finances tightly in particular, or that easing measures do not work effectively due to weak contidence, we may see growth weaken more.

{"text": "Of course, that's not to say we're \"calling the bottom\" or we've seen the lowest prices in risk assets. But it is to say that we've entered the final phase of this severe, acute bear market. And that means we're closer to the \"early stage recovery\" phase than we were over the past 3 weeks. As such, our strategists around the world have begun suggesting the addition of risk: e Equities (see US Equity Strategy: How Much Downside Is Left? and European Equity Strategy: Too Extreme - Better to Buy), e Credit (see US Credit Strategy Brief: Taking off Hedges, Staying Cautious in Cash), and e Securitized Products (see Agency MBS: Buy the Basis; Cheap Option on Fed Buying Too and US Non-Agency RMBS: Reaching for Resi) It's Finally Time to Sell the US Dollar We are also wading in to the risk-taking camp in currency markets: the time has come to sell the US dollar. For the past couple of months, the USD in the DM space has been caught in a relative range. We think we are poised to trade to the downside, driven by the interrelated combination of aggressive Fed easing (including QE), and a tactical rebound in risk. The DXY may reach, if not breach, the 95 level. EUR/USD, AUD/USD, and USD/CAD are our preferred USD-short trades. At the beginning of the year, markets broadly expected a modestly reflationary theme vis-a-vis global growth. As we laid out here, this put carry primarily in the driver's seat, keeping the USD relatively supported. This state of the world was the middle of our so-called \"USD umbrella\" (see Exhibit 4). We posited that the USD would weaken either if global growth were to improve further or weaken further, which would mean that price changes would dominate total returns again. Stronger growth means USD selling in favor of areas with stronger growth, higher yields, and cheaper valuations. Much weaker growth means rate cuts and the US Losing its yield differential advantage. We're now fully at the lefthand side of the USD umbrella, and thus at the bottom end of this recent range. The question now is whether the USD will breakout to the downside, or if it will rebound back within this range. We think the former. We expect further USD weakness, driven by the interrelated combination of aggressive Fed stimulus and a tactical risk rebound. QE from the Fed as we expect would bea dovish surprise to the market and a clear catalyst for USD weakness. This is particularly the case given an already increasingly risk positive market outlook (at least tactically, anyway).

We need to look beyond historical relationships and dig into policy, which is clearly driving markets right now. Compared to aggressive monetary stimulus from the US, we expect fiscal policy to be relatively more important in Australia and Europe in the coming weeks and months, with monetary stimulus unlikely to match the Fed's. As we describe in more detail here, monetary easing tends to be FX-negative while fiscal easing can be FX-positive. The ECB, RBA and BoC are unlikely to match the Fed. Compared to the Fed going to the ZLB and buying at a $75bn/mo pace, we see Limited risk of either central bank keeping pace. Indeed the ECB's announced additional QE was only EUR120bn over the remainder of the year - compared to an additional $675bn from the Fed if they start on 1 April. What about the RBA? A cut to 25bp, the ELB, is fully priced, and the probability of QE is admittedly rising. However, we don't think the RBA will really come close to the Fed. We provide more detail on this below (see USD | Time to Go Short), but suffice it to say, if the RBA pursues a yield curve control/caps policy as we expect, this will not likely match the Fed's aggressiveness. Meanwhile the BoC cut rates to 75bp this week but Governor Poloz emphasized that his preference is for rates not to go into negative territory.

Meanwhile this week the Government of Canada announced considerable fiscal stimulus as well.", "tokens": 61, "label": "light"}
{"text": "What about Europe? Fiscal easing so far has been relatively reactive and reluctant. However, we still think the risks of both a) a larger fiscal package and b) a proactive stance in Europe are rising. This is both mechanical and a function of circumstance. European growth had already been under pressure amid the 2019 manufacturing slowdown and longstanding structural/demographic challenges. If growth slows further, automatic stabilizers kick in, but more importantly, it puts even more pressure on policymakers to become more proactive. The ECB has consistently told European policymakers that fiscal will be key - let's see if they start listening. In short, though, the probability of proactive fiscal expansion in Europe rises as expected GDP growth falls. So how do you trade? We recommend buying EUR/USD targeting 1.16 but suggest a fairly wide stop (1.08) given ongoing market volatility. Ideally we would enter the trade on a dip at 1.10.

Over the past week starting Tuesday, Treasury yields rose, but the real yields on TIPS rose much more (see Exhibit 10). Liquidity in the Treasury market broke down along several axis, such as in the CTD vs. futures basis market and the off-the-run vs. on-the-run market - prompting the New York Fed to announce various measures aimed at restoring that liquidity (see Addressing Liquidity, But Not Financial Conditions). Largely ignored among this illiquidity was the TIPS market - usually a poster-child for lack of liquidity. And what we saw in term of outflows from the top 7 TIPS ETFs helps explain what went wrong with real yields, and eventually the rates hedge. Exhibit 11 shows that the large inflows in the first week of March drove real yields lower alongside nominal yields. This may have been a flow that was intended to gain exposure to break-even inflation rates. However, as breakeven rates continued to move lower with the sell-off in equities, that massive inflow turned into a massive outflow from TIPS ETFs (see Exhibit Tlagain). This helped cause a spike in TIPS real yields, and it clearly weighed on nominal yields as well.

In what seems like ages ago, on Friday, March 6, the OPEC+ meeting ended without an agreement, which led to a series of tensions, a higher expected supply of oil, and much Lower oil prices (see OPEC No Longer Defends Price - Positioning For $30 (or Lower) Oil). Morgan Stanley's oil strategist, Martijn Rats, estimates that WTI will need to fall to US$30/bbl in 2Q20, and US$35-40/bbl in 2H20 (see OPEC's Sisyphean Task has Ended).

We think this steps taken by the Fed so far are likely to help stresses in the Treasury trading environment, but unlikely to ease financial conditions. We expect the Fed to announce a full fledged QE program that targets $75bn a month of Treasuries, focused on the back-end, while reinvesting maturing agency MBS proceeds. The Fed's steps so far are aimed at alleviating stresses in the Treasury market, particularly linked to the dislocations in off-the-run Treasury bonds, and the cheapest to deliver securities for futures contracts. First, the Fed switched its $60bn/month bill- buying program into a program for buying Treasuries across the curve. Second, the Fed front-loaded the Treasury buying operation by buying $37bn of the monthly $60bn Treasuries on March 13. The Fed's steps work to address the Treasury market's stresses in two ways - first, they allow off-the-run Treasuries to be pared off from primary dealer balance sheets, cleaning up dealer balance sheets and allowing them to facilitate intermediation in the Treasury market again. The fact that primary dealers have already been holding more US government securities today than during QE2 has not helped (see Exhibit 14). Second, it encourages investors to step back in the off-the-run and the cheapest-to- deliver bond space, which has become less expensive . Since the Fed tends to buy the cheaper securities and uses relative value considerations - it incentivizes investors to buy the cheaper off-the-run securities while selling the typically richer on-the-run securities, creating a two-way flow in these bonds.

Pace: The Fed is likely to increase the size of buying from $60bn to at least $75bn Treasuries, 2. Composition: The Fed is likely to focus more on buying longer-dated Treasury securities, in line with QE3 and the maturity-extension program, withdrawing more duration from the market 3. The Fed is likely to switch MBS reinvestments back into the MBS market to offer support to the MBS market. 4. Timing: The Fed is likely to announce a QE type buying as open ended, unlike the switch between bills to coupons, which was only announced for one month. Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA What will full fledged QE look like? The Fed tried a few variations of QE during the last easing cycle, and we draw the applicable lessons, as we think about QE ahead:\n(1) Open ended vs. finite QE: QE1 and QE2 were finite operations with a fixed amount of buying in a stated time window. However, the Fed has since learnt about the value of forward guidance implied by QE, where markets assume that the Fed will not raise rates as Long as QE is ongoing. Given that the Fed has had only a limited room to cut rates in this downturn, the forward guidance aspect of QE is likely to be a helpful tool, and therefore an open ended QE program makes sense in the current environment, in our view, (2) Maturity extension vs. outright buying: The maturity extension program (also known as \"operation twist\") involved selling front end Treasury holdings in the SOMA portfolio, while buying longer dated Treasuries, being net neutral on the size of the Fed's balance sheet.", "tokens": 484, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "On the other hand, outright QE involved only buying, and expanded the Fed's balance sheet. Three things support outright buying over a maturity extension program: e The Fed has already been expanding its balance sheet, and was expected to do so until 2Q20 with its ongoing $60bn a month bill purchases (now converted to coupon buying). Additionally, in our expectation, the Fed was likely to buy $15bn coupon Treasuries across the curve starting in July, as a way of maintaining reserves in the system. Given the already expansionary impulse, the Fed is likely to prefer outright buying than maturity extension, in our view. e The benefits of holding short dated Treasuries: As many FOMC members have noted in the past, holding T-bills was a very useful feature of the Fed's SOMA portfolio during the 2008 crisis. Holding bills (and short term coupon securities) allowed the Fed to raise cash in a short time in 2008, by selling those bills, without having a significant market impact. We do not think the Fed wants to sell its short dated Treasuries and exhaust the possibility of raising cash quickly if needed. e More onus on QE for easing: Given that the Fed starts with only 15Obp rate cuts to offset the recent sharp tightening in financial conditions, we think the Fed will look to use tools with the higher firepower - outright buying instead of maturity extension. Thus, we think the Fed will implement a QE program that is open ended in nature and expands the balance sheet outright. For specifics, we couch the upcoming QE program in terms of four parameters: (i) size (ii) pace (iii) composition and (iv) timing. We think the Fed will announce a QE program that targets $75bn a month of Treasuries, focused on the back-end, while reinvesting maturing agency MBS proceeds. Size: Since the Fed is already expanding the balance sheet, with its buffer building program (now buying coupons at $60bn a month), we do not see balance sheet size as a major consideration for the Fed. Additionally, before the recent tightening in financial conditions, we expected the Fed would have bought $15bn Treasuries across the curve anyway, Starting in July 2020, to maintain the level of reserves in the system. Morgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA Pace: We think the Fed is likely to buy at least $75bn Treasuries per month for the following reasons e Akey variable for the Fed is not only the total notional buying, but also the duration removed from the market. $75bn Treasuries per month with a similar composition as during QE will remove about 25% more duration per month than the $85bn combination of Treasuries and MBS during QE . Given that the Treasury market has grown by nearly 30% since 2013, a pace of $75bn per month is likely to have the same effectiveness as QE in depressing term premiums. The Fed purchased Treasuries at a pace of $75bn a month during QE2, and purchased Treasuries and MBS at a total clip of $85bn a month as part QE oo ($45bn Treasuries, $40bn MBS). We think $75bn per month is in Line with previous QE operations. Given that the Fed is currently buying bills at a pace of $60bn per month, a pace of buying at $75bn per month would be reassuring step up for investors focused on the total size of Fed buying. Composition: Since the housing market is not at the center of the recent tightening in\nfinancial conditions, we think the Fed can buy $75bn Treasuries per month without buying agency MBS. We think the Fed can start reinvesting proceeds from agency MBS back into MBS, as a way of supporting the MBS market. Not adding new MBS purchases would be consistent with the Fed's stated principle of wanting a Treasury-only balance sheet in the long run.

We think the Fed's next QE program is likely to focus on the back-end and look similar to QE 0. Timing: The Fed used a goals based guidance for determining the duration of how long it would buy during QE infinity (see grey box below). We think the duration of buying under any upcoming QE is likely to be open ended, and tied to economic outcomes. December 2012 FOMC statement: The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. Micro Treasury purchase considerations: Finally, by way of reminder, the New York Fed has used its own proprietary spline curve to help decide which issues to buy, in addition to the other criteria listed below, in the past: e Will not purchase Treasuries trading special in the repo market e Will not purchase on-the-run Treasuries e Will not purchase CTDs for active Treasury futures e Will not purchase securities with 4 weeks or less to maturity e Does not plan to purchase STRIPS or WI securities e Place restrictions on pace of purchase of securities where the SOMA holding is above 35% of the total amount outstanding e Will not purchase more than 70% of the total amount outstanding for any one security We think the Fed will continue to use these criteria in the upcoming program, as they are aimed at (1) not creating distortions in the Treasury market and (2) optimizing the cost paid by the Fed, as a public institution, to acquire Treasuries.

Our model suggested that the Maturity Extension Program , in which the Fed bought $45bn a month (27% of it in the 20- to 30-year sector), lowered 30-year term premiums by ~7Obp, whereas the extension of the MEP further lowered term premiums by ~47bp. Notably, the biggest impact of the QE and MEP programs was highest in the back-end as the Fed was concentrating its buying in that sector.

Given that term premiums have come down only slightly recently, we think the market is pricing a less than 10% chance of about a year long QE operation with the same features as the MEP to be announced soon. How are we trading the prospects of QE (and other stimulus) We believe that a sizeable QE, in line with our view, from the Fed is likely to be supportive of risk-on conditions and will ease financial conditions. We expect the Fed to announce QE at or before the March FOMC meeting, which would facilitate adding risk- on trades. However, the path for Treasury yields to move higher could likely go through Lower yields first as the announcement of the Fed's buying actions depresses term premiums at first. In fact, as noted inExhibit 17, 30-year yields went Lower before going higher at the announcement of the QE1, 2, and the MEP operations.

Importantly, those comments were clarified by President Lagarde immediately after the press conference during an appearance on CNBC, in the The ECB Blog by Chief Economist Lane and by a number of other ECB members in the 24 hours after the\nconclusion of the press conference. The Package Details - the APP: The increase in the APP by 120bn by the end of 2020, on top of the existing program and reinvestments, allows for a considerable degree of opportunistic purchases and flexibility in both the private and public sector programmes.

LTRO/TLTROs - An Invitation for Front End Carry Trades? The sweetened changes to the TLTRO Ill terms starting in June and the weekly bridge LTROs beginning next week are substantial for banks, putting market participants in a position to speculate about the likelihood of carry trades in the very front end of yield curves in countries such as Italy, Spain and Portugal, beginning as early as next week. In our view, the LTRO/TLTRO combination was the most powerful aspect of the ECB easing package given that capacity was expanded, the terms were sweeter, the level of Lending to qualify for the best borrowing costs was made easier, the repayment option comes sooner and the bridge LTROs, which can all be rolled into TLTRO Ill.4, start next week. We think commentary from ECB Chief Economist Lane from The ECB Blog confirms that statement: \"Under the new terms for TLTRO Ill, we have increased the volume of funds that banks can borrow from us in order to provide credit to firms and households by more than EUR 1 trillion. This raises the total possible borrowing volume under this programme to almost EUR 3 trillion. Banks can borrow at the most favourable rates we have ever offered.\" Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA The parts of the LTRO/TLTRO mix that we think are the most important for investors to consider are the following:\ne Cheap LTROs Begin Next Week: A new round of weekly fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment will begin next week. Banks will be able to borrow at the average deposit rate during the period (-SObp) with the Loans maturing in time to be fully rolled over for the sweetened TLTRO IIL4. e Substantial Increase in Borrowing Capacity: Banks that were at their 30% borrowing allowance criteria will see an immediate increase in their borrowing capacity given the raise in the borrowing allowance to 50% of February 2019 eligible stock levels. In a country such as Italy, this means remaining TLTRO space inclusive of sales and securitizations, will rise at the aggregate level from 111bn to 329bn (different bank by bank). In Spain, eligible space will rise from 76bn to 214bn. And thats on top of all of the existing TLTRO II money, 215bn in Italy and 130bn in Spain, some of which can also be rolled over in June 2020. e Sweeter Terms: starting at the June TLTRO, banks will be able to borrow between MRO - 25bp and average deposit rate -25bp, with a worst case minimum of -75bp for banks that hit their lending criteria. e Less Lending Expansion Needed To Hit the Sweetened Rate: The lending criteria were reduced from 2.5% to 0%, meaning that all banks need to do is see their eligible stock of debt remain flat during the specified horizon in order to borrow at no worse than -/75bp. While its true that the significantly generous terms are temporary and will likely revert back to the still very favorable September 2019 terms after the first year, they still represent a substantial opportunity for carry trades in places such as Italy, Spain and Portugal where very front end yields have climbed back to or in some instances well above 0%.

In our view and the view of the market, this statement came as a bit of a shock anda distraction from some of the other major highlights of the easing package, since it appeared to stand directly in contrast with years of previous ECB communications, most notably by former President Draghi, that have stressed that the asset purchase programmes have ensured the smooth transmission of the ECBs monetary policy to all member countries. However, since the time of the original statement significant steps have been taken post the press-conference to reiterate the ECB's commitment to the smooth transmission of its monetary policy for all member countries, with some current and former members (Villeroy, de Cos, Visco and Trichet) also stressing that President Lagardes statement was misinterpreted and that the ECB has the ability to buy Italian debt. ECB President Lagarde on CNBC (quoted in a footnote to the Q&A transcript): | am fully committed to avoid any fragmentation in a difficult moment for the euro area. High spreads due to the coronavirus impair the transmission of monetary policy. We will use the flexibility embedded in the asset purchase programme, including with the public sector purchase programme. The package today can be used flexibly to avoid dislocation in bond markets, and we are ready to use the necessary determination and strength ECB Chief Economist Lane in The ECB Blog: We will not tolerate any risks to the smooth transmission of our monetary policy in all jurisdictions of the euro area. We clearly stand ready to do more and adjust all of our instruments, if needed to ensure that the elevated spreads that we see in response to the acceleration of the spreading of the coronavirus do not undermine transmission.\" We think the concerted effort to stress the ECBs commitment to a smooth transmission of the ECBs monetary policy will eventually alleviate some of the post press- conference concerns about a shift away from supporting the periphery, but the ECB may at times have to prove that commitment via their direct purchase activity in financial markets. 21 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA So Is It Time To Play For Periphery Tightening? We think the time is getting close but we are not yet ready to make an active suggestion on a specific trade. There are a number of criteria that we are monitoring in the near term including but not limited to: e stability in Italian and broader euro area COVID-19 numbers a reduction in global equity market volatility and improvement in liquidity conditions e afurther, meaningful response to the virus from the Fed and US politicians in line with those we are currently seeing from a number of countries in both Asia and Europe acontinued commitment from ECB members to ensuring the smooth transition of the ECBs monetary policy for all member countries (there was ample verbal confirmation of this today) @ perhaps some evidence of decent take up in the upcoming bridge LTROs that may lead investors to start speculating that banks may be setting up for front end of the yield curve carry trades in the periphery. We think it will first make sense to consider periphery tightening trades relative to each other, to allow for some protection in the event of a continued broader widening in broader periphery spreads. Currently, BTP tightening opportunities versus both Spain and Portugal may make the most sense in the 2y and 3y parts of the Italian curve given support from buybacks and spread levels that have widened to levels last seen after the EU Parliamentary election. We also see opportunities for Portuguese bonds to tighten versus Spanish bonds should the illiquidity weighing on Portuguese bonds subside. Currently, our macro scoring framework still sees Portuguese fundamentals as the most favorable in Iberia.

The DMO's growth, productivity and revenue projections will likely be adjusted noticeably Lower going forward, while Covid-19 spending will need to be incorporated. We think that the UKT 2s5s curve can steepen towards 20-30bp relative to 5bp today, should it become evident that the PSNB as a percentage of GDP will climb towards 3% or more. We see a less protracted period of Covid-19 concern speeding up that trajectory, but a potentially large QE package from the BoE acting as a risk that could slow any steepening, at least initially (see Fiscal policy, swaps spreads and the UK yield curve). DMO details: The new DMO remit for the 2020/21 fiscal year is based on the OBR forecasts before the coronavirus was expected to have a significant effect on economic activity. They do not include the additional 12bn virus response package announced by the Chancellor. We therefore see substantial upside risks to the 156.1bn planned gilt issuance number, even when taking the extra stimulus into account. The revised remit reflecting the issuance details is set to be published on April 23rd. Details of the 2020-21 DMO Remit The net financing requirement for the DMO in 2020/21 is forecast to be 156.1bn, financed exclusively by gilt sales. Adding the 12bn Covid-19 package brings the planned gilt issuance to 168.1bn (Exhibit 27). When the revised economic projections are taken into account, we expect to see a number north of 17O0bn. Given the additional fiscal stimulus, 2020/21 may see the highest net issuance over the forecast horizon. In terms of the split by maturity bucket, short and medium parts of the curve got allocated a higher proportion of issuance compared to the previous remit, while the proportion of linkers declined substantially (Exhibit 31). The DMO expects continuing demand for short conventional gilts to be driven by redemption reinvestment flows. Medium gilts are expected to be in demand due to their role in facilitating the hedging of a wide range of gilt market exposures (see Debt Management Report 2020-21). The DMO expects to hold six syndications in the next fiscal year, raising ~16bn in four Long conventional syndications and 8bn over two index-linked syndications. 23 Morgan Stanley | eesearcs IDEA Exhibit 27: Projected gilt issuance by fiscal year Source: UK DMO, Morgan Stanley Research estimates Exhibit 28: Issuance split by maturity bucket Exhibit 29: Issuance split versus past remits , bn 180 35% 160 ! 30% 140 ; 25% 120 100 | 20% 80 !", "tokens": 452, "label": "heavy"}

Indeed, CTAs appear to have gone long JGB futures to the tune of more than 10,000 contracts in the first week of March as \"flight to quality\" flows drove the UST market sharply higher (see Exhibit 31). Our impression is that dealers and relative value investors have been taking the short side of these trades. The rollover to the next (in this case June) contract appears to have been unusually slow this time around, with many investors perhaps hesitating as a consequence of the calendar spread having become so illiquid (see Exhibit 32). With liquidity failing to improve even as the final trading day drew closer, CTAs unable to receive cash JGBs as settlement seemingly started to lay on long-roll (sell March / buy June) trades, thereby causing the calendar spread to widen (see Exhibit 33). The CTD spread also shows JB347the cheapest-to-deliver issue for the June contract to be locally rich. In addition to long-roll trades among CTAs, relative value investors and dealers who had already rolled over into June-short positions may have found themselves suddenly needing to cover as CTAs started buying in such an illiquid market, thereby causing the June contract to richen even further. We do not necessarily expect this richness to be corrected until CTAs start liquidating their long positions, but relative value anomalies are unlikely to persist indefinitely given that the eventual return of liquidity should be sufficient to catalyze arbitraging flows.

Moreover, elevated volatility obviously makes it all the more difficult for dealers to go long into an auction. Some life insurers looking to reduce their asset-liability duration mismatches may meanwhile be favoring swaps over JGBs (once again for reasons of cash efficiency). They may have strong incentive to cover duration mismatches particularly now that both Lower risk assets valuation and lower JGB yields forced them to cut the market risks or enhance the capitals. Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA History has also shown that foreigners often use JPY swaps to express \"risk off\" views. Strong foreign demand for super-long JPY swaps is also evident from recent widening of the JSCC-LCH basis. With domestic investors taking a wait-and-see approach to JGBs while both domestic and foreign players use swaps to cover their duration needs, the utility of swaps as a hedge for JGB-long positions has been reduced quite considerably, thereby leaving dealers with little option but to simply sell off their inventory in a manner that causes asset swaps to cheapen even further. This selling pressure has been particularly pronounced <30y sector where absolute- level buyers are lacking (whereas Life insurers and other investors continue to be attracted by the relatively high yields offered beyond the 30y sector), with the 20s30s ASW box spread having tightened as a result (see Exhibit 36). ASW cheapening has not been confined to Japan, with super-long swap spreads widening globally as demand for sovereign bonds declines while derivatives are actively used to cover duration needs (see Exhibit 37) amid the low interest rate world. We see only limited potential for ASW cheapness to be corrected until and unless (1) \"risk on\" sentiment drives up interest rates sufficiently to attract real money investors back to sovereigns or (2) an increase in central bank purchases causes supply/demand to improve in the sovereign bond market.

The question now is whether the USD will breakout to the downside, or if it will rebound back within this range. We think the former. We expect further USD weakness, driven by the interrelated combination of aggressive Fed stimulus and a tactical risk rebound. First, on the Fed, we expect an aggressive stimulus package to ease financial conditions. Beyond cutting to the ZLB, which at this point is fully priced, we expect the Fed to reinstate a QE program of $75bn/mo in Treasuries, and shift reinvestment of MBS back into MBS. Our rates colleagues estimate that this type of package is only about 20% priced in, so this would be a dovish surprise to the market. Aggressive Fed easing likely serves as a catalyst to support an already increasingly risk positive market outlook (at least tactically, anyway). Markets have moved a Lot in the past couple of weeks, with the recent 20%+ drawdown in global equities one of the most aggressive on record (Exhibit 43). Looking across asset classes, the cost-benefit of risk taking is increasingly moving in a positive direction. Against this backdrop, an aggressive monetary stimulus from the US should be sufficient to catalyze the USD to break out of its recent range. Indeed, let's just take a simple view of historical data. Let's assume the US 10 year yield halves from about 100bp to 50Obp. That should give us about a 50bp decline in the broad USD (Exhibit 44). What about risk? Say we get a 10% rally in the S&P 500, which brings us roughly to our equity strategists' year end bear case of 2750. According to Exhibit 45, we should get a 60- 7Obp decline in the broad USD.

We view EUR/USD, AUD/USD and USD/CAD as the most attractive expressions of USD weakness. Compared to aggressive monetary stimulus from the US, we expect fiscal policy to be relatively more important in these areas in the coming weeks and months, with monetary stimulus unlikely to match the Fed's.

{"text": "ECB monetary accommodation may not match the Fed's. Indeed the ECB's announced additional QE was EUR120bn over the remainder of the year. Contrast that with the Fed which, if our forecasts are right, would add $675bn through year-end. More easing from the ECB is still possible, but from a sequencing perspective we think the Fed will more than match the ECB for now. Meanwhile the scope for the BoC to match the Fed seems limited given that Governor Poloz emphasized his preference not to take rates negative and instead discussed the power of fiscal as a useful tool. What about the RBA? A cut to 25bp, the ELB, is fully priced, and the probability of a QE program this year is rising almost in tandem with the tightening in financial conditions. However, here too we see limited scope for the RBA to match the Fed. First, the government bond market in Australia is far smaller (A$550bn), and Governor Lowe has all but ruled out buying private assets and negative rates. We plan to explore a potential RBA QE program in greater detail at a later date. However, we think some form of yield curve control/caps seems an elegant solution for a QE program given the RBA's stated goals (reducing interest rates both by narrowing cash-OlS spreads and lowering OIS as QE is a form of guidance that hikes are unlikely anytime soon) and constraints (a small bond market). We also think they would want to ensure the curve remains upward sloping, with ACGB yields remaining above the cash rate, to limit the negative impact on bank profitability and lending. 35 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Importantly, though, this framework is unlikely to outmatch Fed stimulus, nor is it likely to generate considerable FX weakness (compared to the upside risks from fiscal expansion and a sequenced recovery in Asia).", "tokens": 308, "label": "medium"}

Those which have weakened the most arguably have most scope to rebound -Which central banks have least scope to ease? Here we look at relative central bank policy rates. A central bank with less scope to ease relative to the Fed's aggressive action suggests a greater chance of currency appreciation. -How liquid is the currency? The intuition here is that currency pairs with lower liquidity tend to move more all else equal. So if one were to put on a USD short position ahead of a Fed QE surprise, the less liquid currency pair probably moves more in price terms ceteris paribus. -What is the sensitivity to the US 10Y yield? If the Fed announces a QE package of $75bn/mo with an emphasis on long-end purchases (as we expect), we'd expect nominal yields to fall. Currencies with the most negative beta to the 10Y yield should appreciate the most on falling yields. -What is the sensitivity to the S&P 500? If risk is going to tactically rebound, in part driven by Fed easing, the currency with the most positive beta to the S&P 500 would likely appreciate the most. The results offer a mixed view of currencies - which is in part why we took a more fundamental approach. The results for JPY are a great example here. USD/JPY has the most negative beta to the US 10Y yield, so it should weaken under a falling yield scenario. On the other hand, using the beta to risk, we would draw the exact opposite conclusion. One currency that looks surprisingly positive based on these results is the NOK. It is relatively illiquid compared to G10 peers, with an FX turnover rate closer to that of a large EM country rather than a DM one (Exhibit 33).

Their USD hedging costs have declined to the lowest levels since 2016, and hedging flows could form a relatively higher proportion of trading volumes in the respective USD/CCY derivatives markets.

When making an investment, an investor has two initial decisions to make: (i) which country to invest in (which depends on the economic growth prospects) and (ii) whether to hedge the currency risk if it is a foreign investment (which depends on interest rate differentials and assumptions on FX). 42 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Exhibit 60: Eurozone, Japan, UK, China and Canada are the Exhibit 61: S&P 500 falling back towards the December top foreign holders of US long-term securities 2018 low 45 Z 3500 3500 = Top 20 foreign holders of US long-term securities (USDtrn) == US IG corporate bond index (rhs) =S&P 500 index 4.0 3400 3250 3300 3000 3200 2750 3100 3000 2500 2900 2700 2000 2600 1750 2500 15 16 17 18 19 20 Source: Macrobond, Morgan Stanley Research. Note: EMU excludes Belgium's holdings as it Source: Bloomberg, Macrobond, Morgan Stanley Research may include custodian holdings. To determine which currency could stand to gain most from an increase in USD hedging flows, there are two aspects to consider: (i) the potential size of the flow and (ii) the incentive of the local investor to hedge. The first question to consider then is who owns the most USD assets? As of November 2019, the Eurozone, Japan, the UK, China, Canada, Switzerland, Taiwan, Norway, Singapore, Korea and Australia were among the largest holders of US equities and bonds (Exhibit 60). While this includes the USD holdings of entities which may be fully FX-hedged (e.g. banks) or do not FX hedge (e.g. Japanese and Korean pension funds and Norway's sovereign wealth fund), it serves as a useful starting point. As a significant proportion of China's USD asset holdings are in US Treasuries for FX reserve management purposes, currency hedging is less relevant. Who has bought the most USD assets at expensive levels? It is, however, not just about who owns the most USD assets. Foreign investors who are making a loss on their USD holdings would face more pressure to liquidate these assets or FX hedge to reduce the value at risk. Since early 2018, the USD has been strong and USD hedging costs have risen to high levels, so more foreign inflows into USD assets in the past two years could have been FX-unhedged. In addition, US risk assets like equities and corporate bonds have been rallying in the past two years, so foreigners were buying these US assets at high valuation levels. With US equities now almost fully retracing the gains since 2017 (Exhibit 61), the pressure for these foreign investors to increase FX hedges if not liquidate their USD holdings would seem to be rising. The pressure on Japan, UK, Eurozone and Canada investors may be the highest as they have been the biggest buyers of USD assets (including equities) since 2018 (Exhibit 62 and Exhibit 63).

{"text": "Note: EMU excludes Belgium's holdings as it may include custodian holdings. How has each currency performed against the USD? Another factor playing into foreign investors P&L on their USD portfolio is how the USD/CCY pair has moved. From the foreign investor's perspective, if USD weakens, then it reduces the returns on their USD assets when converted back to local currency. This may give the foreign investor higher incentive to increase their USD hedges, particularly if they are also making losses on the asset price moves. From this angle, JPY, CHF and TWD investors have higher incentive to FX hedge. However, the level of the currency matters too. As we wrote last week, given Japanese lifers forecast range for USD/JPY is around 100-115, we don't expect them to hedge USD assets in earnest unless the Fed cuts rates to zero and USD/JPY falls below 100.

One other factor playing into investors incentive to hedge is the cost. Assuming that investors hedge using rolling 3m forwards, the annualised USD hedging cost has cheapened up most significantly for NOK, SEK, CAD and GBP investors since the start of 2018 (Exhibit 66). Generally, USD hedging costs have declined to the lowest since 2016/17 for many low- yielding G10 currencies. NOK and AUD investors now get a small yield pickup for hedging USD exposure, while hedging costs are relatively low for CAD and SGD investors (Exhibit 67). What are foreign investors existing USD hedge ratios? One of the factors determining the amount of potential USD hedging flows is how much that countrys investors have already hedged their USD assets. For example, Korean lifers have already almost fully hedged their foreign fixed income positions while the national pension fund doesn't hedge any of their foreign investments. This leaves mainly only the lifers' equity holdings available for hedging. Korea's holdings of US equities (including the pension fund's holdings) is only US$166bn, meaning there may not be large potential for USD hedging flows.

A last factor to consider from an FX investor's point of view is whether the hedging flows are large enough to generate a market impact. Indeed, a US$10bn flow hardly looks significant in a EUR/USD derivatives market that trades US$1.2trn a day on average, but will likely move the FX rate in the US$69bn-a-day USD/SEK derivatives market. Exhibit 70 provides some context around the flows generated from a hypothetical 1% increase in the local investor's hedging of their USD assets.

{"text": "In 2015, the BoC revised its estimate of the effective lower bound for its overnight target (i.e., the midpoint of its range) from 0.25% to -0.50%.

However, BoC Governor Poloz said at a press conference today announcing a 50bp intermeeting cut that he \"doesn't like the idea that much\" of negative rates, and - in contrast with today - negative interest rates are \"usually in situations where there is less fiscal firepower.\" Therefore, we think medium-term BoC expectations are unlikely to fall much further, even if global growth expectations and oil prices continue to decline.

Based on historical precedent, assumes that a 100bp change in policy rates expectations (BoC expectations rising relative to Fed expectations) is associated with a roughly 6% fall in USDCAD, a 1% rise in WTI prices is associated with a roughly 0.1% rise in CAD, and a $1bn increase in the Feds balance sheet is associated with a roughly 0.05% increase in CAD (window = Nov-08 to Jan-13). Variables are measured in one month changes. Baseline assumptions: Given our expectation that the Fed cuts to zero in the near term and launches a $75b/month QE program, our baseline expectation is for the market to position for a high probability that the BoC cuts to 0.25% with forward guidance that rates will stay Low for several quarters. However, we see near-term upside to our commodity strategy colleagues' expectation that WTI oil prices will fall to $30/barrel in 2Q, consistent with our equity and cross- asset strategy colleagues recommendation to add risk exposure. Therefore, we assume a rise in WTI prices to $35/barrel, CAD OIS at 0.25%, USD OIS at 0.125%, and the Fed's balance sheet to expand at $75b/month. 5/7 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Exhibit 95: USD/CAD risk reversals look expensive 0.40 USDCAD 3m 25D risk reversal/implied volatility 0.35 Our model suggests those conditions would be consistent with USD/CAD trading at 1.3634. However, if the market were to expect the BoC to cut deeper (to its estimated effective lower bound at -0.50% and keep rates there), USD/CAD could trade substantially higher.

Despite some fiscally expansionary measures announced by President Trump today, we continue to expect a significant stimulus package from the Federal Reserve next week. BoC policy expectations have limited room to fall further, as the market already expects the BoC to cut to the zero Lower bound (0.25%). And the potential for a continued near-term risk asset recovery (including oil) should benefit CAD.

{"text": "The impact of the OPEC+ breakdown on oil prices has of course been one of this week's major themes, but on that matter we refer you to Global Macro Strategy: Impact of Oil on Rates and FX' (11 Mar 2020). Below we discuss the relationship (if any) between JGB linkers and the Cabinet Office's Indexes of Business Conditions while also factoring in the comments (Japanese only) made by economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura at the time of the latter's (preliminary January) release on March 6. The coincident index (2015=100) did rise for the first time in four months, but the Cabinet Office left its (mechanically determined) assessment at \"worsening\". This marks the first time we have seen six consecutive \"worsening\" assessments since the GFC period spanning June 2008 through April 2009, and is in large part a reflection of recent US- China trade tensions given that production-related indicators (output and shipments) have such a high weight within the coincident index. It is therefore necessary to also take other indicators into consideration, as the Cabinet Office has clearly done in formulating its (February) Monthly Economic Report assessment to the effect that \"The Japanese economy is recovering at a moderate pace\". 66 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Source: Cabinet Office, Morgan Stanley Research The coincident and leading indices have been weakening, however. Indeed, the leading index came in at 90.3 for January to mark its Lowest level since November 2009 (Exhibit 112). We also note that the Cabinet Office's Leading index exhibits correlation with our own Morgan Stanley Financial Conditions Index (MSFCI) (Exhibit 113). This is perhaps only to be expected given that the leading index includes the money stock (M2), the Nikkei Commodity Price Index (42 items), and the TOPIX stock price index as components, but we would nevertheless note that whereas the MSFCI is intended as a gauge of US financial conditions, the Cabinet Office's leading index consists solely of Japan-specific indicators. A deterioration in the latter is thus likely to portend a deterioration in both economic and financial conditions domestically. In this regard the Cabinet Office indicated in its latest Monthly Economic Report that \"attention should be given to (...) the effects of fluctuations in the financial and capital markets\". Nishimura's statement to accompany the Indexes of Business Conditions release (which has yet to be officially translated into English) appears to have been aimed at bridging the gap between the aforementioned mechanical \"worsening\" assessment vis-a-vis the coincident index and the \"recovering at a moderate pace\" assessment vis-a-vis the overall state of the Japanese economy. This unusual step was perhaps taken in a bid to alleviate anxiety over the same day's downward revision of 4Q real GDP growth (to -7.1% QoQ annualized) at a time when COVID-19 was of course already weighing on sentiment. Unfortunately Nishimura's statement did not end up attracting major headlines, however, and nor did it appear to have a significant impact on financial asset prices, which is understandable given that neither the Indexes of Business Conditions nor the Monthly Economic Report appear to be given all that much weight by market participants. That said, the outlook for financial conditions is obviously of great potential relevance to JGBi investors. 67 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Breakevens can basically be expected to rise when monetary conditions are accommodative, while weakness in the leading index will ordinarily point to a decline in breakevens. It is however important to stress that (1) even the \"leading\" index is based on data that are already around two months old and (2) the JGBi market continues to be driven almost exclusively by supply/demand factors. In any case, while the JGBi market may continue to look like a \"carefree recluse, investors would still be well advised to monitor not only inflation and supply/demand trends, but also the aforementioned indicators as to how the overall Japanese economy might be faring (.. note that as we are writing this, breakevens fell to -11.8bp post weak rinban operations on March Wednesday 11).", "tokens": 664, "label": "heavy"}

{"text": "In the US, we discuss the reasons for and the impacts of the most recent Fed announcement in which the Fed symbolically is providing unlimited liquidity and beginning to buy coupons. Although the Fed is offering considerable amounts of liquidity via repo, the limiting factor remains dealer balance sheets and what dealers can afford to intermediate. Likely to be more effective in easing dealer balance sheets and aiding liquidity is further purchases of USTs across the curve. This removes securities from dealer inventory, freeing up balance sheets for repo intermediation and other funding intermediation (via FX, etc). Lastly, we provide a set of liquidity metrics that we find quite useful for tracking how banks are able to fund themselves and how dollar funding gets transmitted throughout the system. Japan In Japan, we discuss the aggressive widening of USDJPY basis this week. We believe that not only the widening of credit spreads but also the weakening dealer's intermediation function caused the widening of USDJPY basis across the curve. Moreover, widening has been particularly pronounced for the USD/JPY pair this week, suggesting that Japan-side factors may have had a relatively strong impact. We believe that continued unwinding of carry positioning as well as the liquidation of USD denominated JGB positions on the back of lower hopes for a rate cut in the near-term accelerated the widening move. However, our US economists expect next week's FOMC outcome to include open- ended quantitative easing and reinvesting of maturing agency MBS proceeds back into the MBS market (rather than in USTs as at present). Such measures would be tantamount to direct Fed involvement in the credit market and should therefore provide at least some measure of reassurance. Counter-trend positioning could of course be risky as of now with markets still so volatile, but positioning on a reversal of recent basis widening might very well prove lucrative depending on how next week's FOMC meeting pans out. 69 Morgan Stanley | kesearce IDEA MORGAN STANLEY & CO.", "tokens": 330, "label": "medium"}

{"text": "These three operations, plus the $58bn decline in the overnight operation, only resulted in an additional $61bn of repo today. 70 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA So, let's take a step back...why did the Fed want to effectively offer unlimited liquidity to primary dealers and why was it not successful thus far? This week, there was a dramatic expansion in the CTD basis, widening in xccy basis, lack of term funding, and lack of liquidity in Treasury markets. Overnight and shorter-term GC, though cheaper, fared relatively well. But the other factors were particularly worrisome as the Treasury market is supposed to be one of the most liquid markets. Part of the reason there was such little liquidity is that dealer balance sheets were getting stuffed with Treasuries - particularly off-the-runs - as investors were closing risk positions and de-levering. To further strain balance sheets, some corporates may have begun drawing credit lines on banks, creating new bank assets that have to be met with increased capital per regulatory requirements. So the Fed stepped in to address the \"highly unusual disruptions\" in the Treasury market. They provided virtually unlimited repo, as described above. But is this effective? Given that of the $1.5tn of new term repo the Fed has offered, only $119.5bn has been taken down suggests that dealers do not have the balance sheet capacity to intermediate funding markets, and no amount of repo offered can fix that. Repo operations are balance sheet additive, so if banks are facing liquidity and balance sheet constraints, they just won't partake in the operations at all. As such, if Treasury liquidity remains poor and funding markets remain stressed, the Fed may have to look to expanding counterparties on the operations, initiating other liquidity programs such as TAF, reinstating FX swap lines with foreign central banks, etc. But the Fed didn't only add to repo operations it also decided to switch its $60bn of monthly T-bill purchases into $60bn of monthly purchases across the curve, in equal proportions to the amount of Treasuries outstanding into each of the 11 sectors that the Fed reinvests in MBS rollovers. That means that in this upcoming month, the Fed intends to buy $80bn of Treasury securities in the secondary market ($60bn that were T-bill purchases and $20bn from MBS rollovers). While the transmission mechanism for clearing up balance sheets is much more clear in this case, the size is likely insufficient. When the Fed purchases USTs from the market, it is removing those Treasuries from primary dealers' sheets and creating reserves in its place. Therefore, this is neutral for bank balance sheets, whereas repo is additive. Furthermore, the Fed is purchasing off-the-runs and CTD, creating less supply of the securities, cleaning up dealer inventories and in turn, hopefully improving liquidity. But just how many Treasuries do primary dealers hold? As Exhibit 3 shows, primary dealers held $176bn in USTs. Over the last week, this number has likely moved much higher as investors de-levered, selling Treasuries (among other assets classes). We would not be surprised to see holdings over $250bn, which would be all-time highs. 71 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA Exhibit 116: Dealer holdings of USTs as of March 4th Exhibit 117: Government MMF AUM and 1w changes to AUM Sbn 250 Sbn Sbn 3,000 200 200 2,000 150 130 2,000 100 100 1,500 50 1,000 : ) | 0 50 500 -50 0 Mar-15 Mar-16 Mar-17 Mar-18 Mar-19 0 -100 - Total Primary Dealer Holdings Jan-07 Jan-10 Jan-13 Jan-16 Jan-19", "tokens": 584, "label": "heavy"}

So, all-in-all, only $80bn through April 13% in reduced Treasury holdings will likely not be sufficient to ease dealer balance sheets. Today alone, the Fed front-loaded purchases, buying $37bn in Treasuries across five sectors to try and alleviate the disruptions in the Treasury market. Given that this $37bn is nearly half of the total $80bn of Treasuries that the Fed plans to buy between today and April 13\", this suggests to us that the Fed may have a larger purchase plan ready to go (please see FOMC Preview: To Infinity and Beyond!).

{"text": "For example, there are signs that dollar intermediation functions might be breaking down, with term GC-OIS spreads and FX swap cost vs. term GC repo spread differentials remaining wide despite the Fed's massive injection of liquidity (see Exhibit 119). Our US short duration strategist argues that because Fed repo operations can only be accessed by primary dealers, there is a risk of investors being unable to access cheap and abundant funding at times when dealers face constraints on the degree to which they can expand their balance sheets (such as usually happens towards the end of the calendar year) (United States | Title). This has likely helped to keep short-end basis swap spreads wider. A widening of (negative) short-end basis swap spreads will tend to reduce the incentive to hold paying positions for carry-generating purposes. Moreover, Bo} rate cut expectations have been dialed back sharply after the ECB ended up leaving its policy rate on hold. This rethink gave foreign real money investors an incentive to sell off short-end JGBs, with the resulting unwinding of positions perhaps contributing to basis widening as USD liquidity was effectively sucked out of the short- to medium-term sector. Widening has been particularly pronounced for the USD/JPY pair this week, suggesting that Japan-side factors may have had a relatively strong impact (seeExhibit 120). Are counter-trend (contrarian) plays warranted at this juncture? Our US economists expect next week's FOMC outcome to include open-ended quantitative easing and reinvesting maturing agency MBS proceeds back into the MBS market (rather than in USTs as at present). Such measures would be tantamount to direct Fed involvement in the credit market and should therefore provide at least some measure of reassurance. Counter-trend positioning could of course be risky as of now with markets still so volatile, but positioning on a reversal of recent basis widening might very well prove lucrative depending on how next week's FOMC meeting pans out. 74 Morgan Stanley | sesearcs Exhibit 119: 3m GC-OIS spread and 3m USDJPY FX swap cost vs 3m GC repo spread Spread 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 -20 May-16 May-17 May-18 May-19 == 3m USDJPY FX swap vs 3m GC repo spread 3mGC-OIS spread Source: Morgan Stanley Research, Bloomberg it IDEA Exhibit 120: 1y XCCY basis movement Spread 20 0 20 AQ -60 -80 -100 May-16 May-17 May-18 May-19 USDJPY ly basis | -EURUSD 1y basis", "tokens": 397, "label": "medium"}

Over the last two weeks, the market has been forced to (1) digest the speed of increase in the number of positive COVID-19 cases and assess the effectiveness of (or lack thereof) containment measures and the corresponding economic impact across the globe, (2) anticipate and react to the degree and scope of easing metrics in Liquidity injections, policy rate decisions, and asset purchase programs as well as interventions in the currency market from global central banks and the possibility and size of fiscal IDEA 76 Morgan Stanley | sesearct IDEA stimulus packages, and (3) quantify whether the failure to achieve an agreement to reduce future production at the OPEC talks and the beginning of an oil war will be positive or negative for the domestic and global economies. Any single incident above would have caused market turmoil and presented challenges for investors to readjust their portfolio positioning. Yet this time they all arrived together. It is then to no one's surprise that in the past two to three weeks, yield curve dynamics and the rate volatility surface encountered seismic swings that were also associated with excessive intra-day volatilities and lack of market depth. The whole OTC vanilla swaption vol surface, including the level, the expiry calendar, and the tail term structure, is now trading at the most extreme levels in a decade.

The whole gamma surface across tail points remains extremely elevated, despite the whole swap rate curve now trading between 0.4% and 1.0%, a range very close to the effective lower bound. The extremely high intra-day and close-to-close volatility as well as the lack of market depth have kept a bid tone in vol for the gamma expiry. However, intermediate expiry points on short-end rates, e.g., 3y2y, have actually softened a few basis points in annualized terms since mid-February. It only took the market what seems like a blink of the eye to skip the forward guidance and decide that the zero rate backdrop is here to stay. As we noted in last most recent weekly, Global Macro Strategist: Hello, what is your emergency?, we have seen the forward OIS curve evolving since the beginning of March in a way similar to that at the end of the 2008 easing cycle. It almost seems as if the current episode is a speeded-up version of 2008. In 2020, the market only needed two to three weeks to: (1) price in a extremely steep rate cut path to the effective Lower bound, even after the Fed's 5Obp inter-meeting cut, (2) extend a complete flat forward OIS curve at least through year-end 2020, and (3) look beyond zero rates and forward guidance and start to price in QE programs.", "tokens": 562, "label": "heavy"}

Our duration strategist sees about a 20% chance priced in the current Treasury market for a one-year Long QE program, at $75bn Treasuries per month (see the United States | A QuEasy Treasury market section). As such, despite the rich valuations in the long end of the curve, a QE program of the size we envision could push valuations to even more extreme levels. We do not yet suggest it is time to fade the extreme from a duration perspective. Vol-wise, should the Fed deliver a QE package in line with QE3 at or before the March FOMC meeting as our economists and duration strategists envision, we think the ly to 3y expiry segment across tails will soften significantly and the expiry term structure will become less inverted or more upward sloping. We think the gamma surface (e.g., expiry <ly) may encounter an initial spike, but when the dust settle, it should also follow the same move as intermediate part of the surface. Fading the high vol and the expiry inversion in the gamma needs much higher accuracy in timing the market reaction to the policy responses. Given the current global market turmoil and extremely thin liquidity, trade execution in the gamma surface will likely to continue to face a higher transaction cost. Given this analysis, we suggest the trade idea below (with an entry target of 12bp vol spread) as a relative value play to take advantage of the expiry vol surface with an embedded view on the timing, the size, and the scope of QE program. The risk of the trade is if the Fed doesnt deliver a full-fledged QE program in the coming months and global risk sentiment continues to deteriorate. In such a case, ly vs 3y expiry vol surface could continue to march higher.

On the other hand, 40y JGB have lagged the global bond rally, thereby becoming another room to rally Markets are fully priced for a Bank of England cut by the May meeting, but we believe there is attractive risk/reward for investors who think the MPC will only cut once or not at all given an expectation that fiscal stimulus will be incorporated in the May MPC meeting. We think that buying calendar spread steepeners in the 4-6bp range is a cheap way to position for the possibility of, but by no means the guarantee of, a modest normalization in 2021 following the strategy review. We see the inclusion of owner-occupied housing in the measurement of HICP as a key contributor to this view.

Public sector spending takes longer to materialize, resulting in only a modest increase in Gilt issuance over the forecast horizon. The pent-up private sector investment that our economists anticipate should there be greater clarity about the way forward for Brexit does not materialize, as a new round of uncertainty about trade negotiations with the EU keeps private sector uncertainty elevated. The Irish macroeconomic outlook worsens vs. that of Belgium. A Brexit outcome arises which is disruptive to Ireland's economy. If data prints are poor, this may lead to a more dovish MPC. US and China reach a partial trade agreement, and global risk sentiment recovers quickly. The risk for these trades is that the long-end swap could reverse the current bull-flattening move.

{"text": "In a distributed system, actions execute in multiple locations; in this context, actions are often named events. Examples of events in distributed systems include sending or receiving messages, or changing some state in a node. Not all events are related, but some events can cause and influence how other, later events, occur. For instance a reply to a received mail message is influenced by that message, and maybe by other prior messages also received. Events in a distributed system can either occur in a close location such as different processes running in the same machine, at nodes inside a data center, or geographically spread across the globe, or even at a larger scale in future interplanetary networks. Relations of potential cause and effect between events are fundamental to the design of distributed algorithms, and nowadays few services can claim not to have some form of distributed algorithm at its core. Before we try to make sense of these cause and effect relations, it is nec- essary to limit their scope to what can be perceived inside the distributed system itself we can refer to this as internal causality. Naturally, a dis- tributed system interacts with the rest of the physical world outside it, and there are also cause and effect relations in that world at large. For example, consider a couple planning a night out using a system that manages reserva- tions for dinners and cinema. One person reserves the dinner and calls the other on the phone saying that.", "tokens": 250, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "After receiving the phone call, the second person goes to the system and reserves the cinema. The reservation man- agement system has no way to know that the first reservation has actually caused the second one. Figure 1: An assignment event, over variable a, influences the later condition. This external causality cannot be detected by the system, and can only be approximated by physical tume. However, time totally orders all events, even those unrelated, thus it is no substitute to causality [20]. In this text, we focus on characterizing internal causality, the causality that can be tracked by the system. Happened-before relation This brings us to 1978, when Leslie Lamport defined a partial order, happened before, that connects events of a distributed systems that are potentially causally linked [12]. An event c can be the cause of an event e, or c happened before e, if both occur in the same node and c executed first, or, being at different nodes, if e could know the occurrence of c thanks to some message received from some node that knows about c. If neither event can know about the other, we say they are concurrent. When we say that two events are potentially causally linked, we recognize that even if we know an event could have an impact on a causally succeeding one, the semantics of the actual events can make the later one independent from the former. A simple example is captured in Figure |1| where the as- signment of variable b precedes the if statement but does not influence its outcome. Figure |2} shows an example of a distributed system. An arrow between nodes represents a message sent and delivered. We can see that both Bobs positive answer to the dinner suggestion by Alice, and Chris later request to join the party, are both influenced by Alices initial question about plans for dinner. Looking at the events in this distributed computation, a simple way to check if an event c could have caused another event e (c happened before e) is to find at least one directed path linking c to e. If such a connection is found we mark this partial order relation by c e to denote the happened before relation or potential causality.", "tokens": 377, "label": "medium"}

The fact that Chris was bored didnt influence Alices question about dinner, nor the other way around. We can now recapitulate the three possible relations between two events x and y: (a) x might have influenced y, if > y; (b) y might have influenced x, if y > x; (c) no observable influence among x and y, as they occurred concurrently x || y. Causal Histories Causality can be tracked in a very simple way by using causal histories (5). The system can locally assign unique names to each event (e.g. node name and local increasing counter) and collect, and transmit, sets of events to capture the known past. For a new event, the system creates a new unique name and the causal history is comprised of the union of this name and the causal history of the previous event in the node. For example, the second event in node C is assigned name C2 and its causal history is H, = {c,, 2} (shown in Figure]3). When a node sends a message, the causal history of the send event is sent with the message. On reception, the remote causal causal history is merged (by set union) to the local history. For example, the delivery of the first message from node A to B merges the remote causal history, {a 1, a2}, with the local history, {6}, and the new unique name, bo, leading to {4a1, a2, b), be}. Checking causality between two events x and y, can be tested simply by set inclusion: x y iff H, C H,. This follows from the definition of causal histories, where the causal history of an event will be included in the causal a},a2} {@1,a2,a3 } eo > Node A vvsse tary 4", "tokens": 393, "label": "medium"}

Even better, if we distinguish the last local event added to the history (denoted in bold in the diagram) we can use a simpler test: > y iff x H, e.g. a, be, since ay {a1, a2, b1, bo}. This follows from the fact that a causal history includes all events that (causally) precede a given event. Vector Clocks It should be obvious by now, that causal histories work but are not very compact. We can address this problem by relying on the following observation: the mechanism of building the causal history implies that if an event 63 is present in H,, then all preceding events from that same node, 6; and 0, are also present in H,. Thus, it suffices to store the most recent event from each node. Causal history {a, da, b1, be, b3, C1, C2, c3} is compacted to {a +> 2,b+4 3,c> 3}, or simply a vector [2, 3, 3]. Graphically, this can be represented by assigning columns to each source of events and using the column height to depict how many events are known. 3 2 1 ABC Now, we can translate the rules used with causal histories to the new compact vector representation. For verifying that x y, we needed to check if H, C H,. This can be done, verifying for each node, if the unique names contained in H, are also 4 Figure 4: Run in a distributed system with three nodes: vector clocks. contained in H, and there is at least one unique name in H, that is not contained in H,. This is immediately translated in checking if each entry in the vector of x is smaller or equal to the correspondent entry in the vector of y and one entry is strictly smaller, i.e., V2 : V,{2] < V,|] and 47 : Vi[97| < Vy ly]. This can be stated more compactly by x > y iff V, < V,. Clocks that follow this property are said to characterize causality. If we turn to the graphical representation, this translates into testing if one area is strictly covered by the other. For instance checking [2,3,2] < [2, 3, 3] becomes: < It also becomes intuitive to subtract areas to highlight the additional Hob The reader might notice that in general the result of the subtraction is no longer representable by a vector, but can still be captured by causal history notation i.e. [2,3,3] [2,3,2] = {c3}.", "tokens": 477, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "Later in this text we will present eficient encoding notations that can cover some of these cases. For a new event, the creation of a new unique name is equivalent to incrementing the entry in the vector for the node where the event is created. For example, the third event in node 6 has vector [2,3,0], that corresponds to the creation of event 63 of the causal history. To capture graphically the requirements for local unique event creation we need to keep track of the identity (column) that is controlled in a give node. This is done by adding an identity layer under the event bar. At node b with vector [2, 2,0] we have: 2 1 id ABC Having the identity clearly defined, creation of unique events simply trans- lates into an area increase over the controlled identity: event ( ) = Finally, doing the union of two causal histories, H, and H,,, is equivalent to taking the point-wise maximum of the correspondent two vectors V, and V,, ie, Vi: Vie] = max(V,|2], V,[]). The intuition is that, for the unique names generated in each node, we only need to keep the one with the largest counter. When receiving a message, besides merging the causal histories, a new event is created. The vector representation of these steps can be seen, for example when the first message from a is received in 6, where taking the point-wise maximum leads to [2,1,0] and the new unique name finally leads to [2, 2, 0. Graphically the point-wise maximum combines the two areas that repre- sent known events, by returning the maximum across all columns. For the above example, the events received from a are combined via max with those in 6 by a ) = ine then, all known events are combined with bs identity and a new message reception event is created by event \"2 ) = ee This compact representation is known as vector clock and was introduced around 1988 [8| [14]. As explained, vector comparison is an immediate trans- lation of set inclusion of causal histories, or as simple area inclusion. This equivalence is often forgotten in modern descriptions of vector clocks, and can make what is a simple encoding problem into an unnecessarily complex and arcane set of rules, breaking the intuition. Dotted Vector Clocks When using causal histories, we have shown that knowing the last event could simplify comparison by simply checking if the last event is included in the causal history. This can still be done with vectors, if we keep track in which node the last event has been created. For example, when questioning if = [2,0,0] > y = [2,3,0], with boldface indicating the last event in each vector, we can simply test if x[0] < y[0] (2 < 2) since we have marked that the last event in x was created in node a, i.e., it corresponds to the first entry of the vector. Since marking numbers in bold is not a very practical implementation, the last event is usually stored outside the vector (and sometimes called a dot): e.g.", "tokens": 517, "label": "heavy"}
{"text": "[2,2,0] can be represented as |2, 1, 0|bo. Notice that now the vector represents the causal past of bj, excluding the event itself. This strategy of decoupling the last event can also be captured graphi- cally: [2,2,0) = [2,1,0)b2 = aan\nVersion Vectors In an important class of applications there is no need to register causality for all the events in a distributed computation. For instance, when modifying replicas of data, it often suffices to only register events that create new versions. In this case, when thinking about causal histories, we only need to assign a new unique name to these relevant events. Still, we need to propagate the causal histories when messages are propagated from one site to the other and the remaining rules for comparing causal histories remain unchanged. Node A ms a oe {bi } M {a1 ,b1,b2 } > 6 so Figure 5: Run in a distributed system with three nodes, where only some events are relevant: causal histories. Figure [5] presents the same example as before, but with events not being registered for causality tracking denoted with o. If the run represents the updates to replicas of a data object, we can see that after node a and 0 are concurrently modified, the state of replica a is sent to replica b (in a message). When the message is received in node 0, it is detected that two concurrent updates have occurred, with histories {a,} and {b,}, as neither a; 6; nor b; a,. In this case, a new version that merges the two updates is created (merge is denoted by the symbol M), which requires creating a new unique name, leading to {a,, b,,b2}. When the state of replica b is later propagated to replica c, as no concurrent update exist in replica c, no new version is created. Again we can use vectors to compact the representation. The resulting representation is known as version vector and was created in 1983 |16], five years before vector clocks. Figure [6] presents the same example as before, represented with version vectors.

In some cases, when the state of one replica is propagated to the other replica, the two versions are kept by the system as conflicting versions. For example, in Figure|7| when the message from node a is received in node 0, the system keeps each causal history, {a,;} and {b,}, associated to the respective version. lhe causal history associated with the node containing both version is {a,,b,}, the union of the causal history of all versions. This approach allows to later check for causality relations between each version and other versions when merging the state of additional nodes. The conflicting versions could also be merged, creating a new unique name, as in the example.

Using the normal rules for checking for concurrent updates, these two versions are concurrent. In the example, the system keeps both concurrent updates. For simplicity we omitted interactions of server I with its own clients, but we can see that before receiving data from server 5 it had a single version that depicted three updates managed by server T, causal history {t;, te, ts}, and after that it holds two concurrent versions. An important observation is that in each node, the union of the causal histories of all versions includes all generated unique name until the last known one: for example, in server 5, after both clients send their new ver- sions, all unique names generated in are known. Thus, the causal past of any update can always be represented using a compact vector representation, as it is the union of all versions known at some server when the client read the object. The combination of the causal past represented as a vector and the last event, kept outside the vector, is known as a dotted version vector 3]. Figure 9] shows the previous example using this representation, that eventually becomes much more compact than causal histories as the system keeps running. The notion of compact vector representation is easier to understand under a graphical representation. An area with no hanging columns or dots is 11 compact, and can be efficiently encoded as a vector depicting column heights. Lets consider again the point in the execution after both clients updated 5 and it holds two concurrent versions. Graphically they can easily be checked to be concurrent since neither area includes the other: SS T | ST A client that reads these versions with a get operation, will get a causal context that reflects the join of these versions. This signifies that it was given access to the combination of the two concurrent causal histories and any update it does later should subsume these versions sa hlCU S T |S T S T if the client keeps server affinity and writes back to S with a put, it gets assigned a new dot sg there S TT and, due to area inclusion, this version will subsume the previous two in 5.", "tokens": 558, "label": "heavy"}

Identity Problems We have seen that local creation of unique events requires each node to have exclusive access to a globally unique identity.", "tokens": 114, "label": "light"}
{"text": "We have glossed over this requirement by simply stating that node 7 holds exclusive access to id z and produces a sequence of unique events ids 7, 22,.... Typically these identifiers are guaranteed to be unique by some external mechanism, like an administrator assigning different names to different nodes. In our graphic representation this can be captured by assigning control of different columns to different nodes. For instance, in a system with three replica nodes we can represent the initial state (still with no events registered) of each nodes version vectors and identities: =: 6 6:olULU Each node is only allowed to add events to the column it controls. For instance, the left node registered one event and the right node two events:", "tokens": 123, "label": "light"}
{"text": "If they all pair-wise join we converge to: : ss It is now appropriate to revisit the 1978 paper that defined causality in distributed systems. Although the paper does not introduce a mechanism that characterizes causality, it does introduce a total ordering that is consis- tent with causality, by way of scalar Lamport clocks. Figure |10|shows how our initial run is tagged with those clocks. Each node keeps a clock that 13 Node Av a Node Bo wr NN . cosessssssssesesessssasaneee Node Cov @ > ee Time os = ~~ ~~ ee He eee ee . Figure 10: Run in a distributed system with three nodes: Lamport clocks. starts at zero and is incremented on each event. Upon message reception the clocks are merged by maximum, and incremented to register the receive event. Using function L to map a given event to its Lamport clock, we use the following expression to see how they are related to causality: y implies that L, < Ly. This total order, consistent with causality, might represent concurrent events as if they are related.", "tokens": 179, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "However, those events that are causally ordered see that order preserved into the total order. Coming back to our graphical reasoning, we can observe that what hap- pens is that all nodes are sharing the same identity. In the run on Figure |10} the system state after the execution is: Although we can see in the execution that the last event in A is concurrent to the last ones in B and C, the clock shows it to be ordered before both. Sharing identity has the obvious advantage of space economy since clocks no longer need to be linear on the number of active nodes [7|. This comes at the cost of no longer characterizing causality and missing detail on concurrent 14 events. A middle ground is to partially share identities and provide a clock system that often detects concurrent events but sometimes might miss them. This is done with plausible clocks |21]. The following configuration gives insight into a three node system with a modulo-2 plausible clock assignment, and thus with entry sharing among the left and right nodes: SlCr Events that might occur concurrently in the left and right nodes will appear to be ordered.", "tokens": 197, "label": "medium"}
{"text": "Interval Tree Clocks We have seen that sharing identities among active nodes can lead to non-characterization of causality and missing concurrency detection. The key to accurate causality tracking is to ensure that each node has access to a section of the identity line, that is exclusive to it, when it needs to register events. While some sharing is possible as long as exclusive sections are present [Lo], it is easier to keep the invariant that no sharing is allowed when addressing a dynamic solution to the management of identifiers. Interval tree clocks provide a causality tracking approach that allows fine control on the set of active nodes and their use of identifiers. The intu- ition, supported by the graphical representation, is that a system comprising several active nodes can be derived by forking any active node, starting from a seed node that initially holds the whole identifier space. In the following example we derive a three node replicated system by forking a seed replica and then forking again the derived replica. Before forking, the seed replica has two events registered: 2 1 id After forking the seed, we have two active nodes, that contain the same causal past: Next we fork the rightmost one and locally register one new event in each, showing that nodes can only add areas inside the columns their current identity allows access to i.e above the identity: a Again, area inclusion allows a clear visual detection of concurrency. In- terval tree clocks are implemented with a recursive encoding scheme that supports algorithmic comparison and correct event registration. We conclude by depicting a join of the rightmost into the leftmost node, showing that the event areas are merged and the identity components are added together: a? Final remarks lIracking causality is important due to several reasons. On one hand, not respecting causality can lead to strange behaviors for users as reported by multiple authors (I]. On the other hand, tracking causality is important in the design of many distributed algorithms. The mechanisms for tracking causality and the rules used in these mech- anisms are often seen as something complex {9} and their presentation often lacks the necessary intuition of how they work. This perception of complexity has an impact on industry adoption. The initial Apache Cassan- dra design in 2009 attempted to adopt causality tracking with vectors clocks and interval tree clocks, but complexity issues and the need for fast writes led the system to end up adopting wall clock timestamps, that can lead to lost updates. In another example |6], the Riak key value store had state explosion problems, due to imperfect detection of causally subsumed replicas, that were only solved when the system was redesigned with dotted version vectors. The most commonly used mechanisms for tracking causality, vector clocks and version vectors, are simply optimized representations of causal histories, 16 which are easy to understand, and can be captured with a simple visual representation. By building on the notion of causal histories, we believe it is simple to understand the intuition behind these mechanisms, to identify how they differ and even possible optimizations. When confronted with an unfamiliar causality tracking mechanism, or when trying to design a new sys- tem that requires it, we urge the reader to fall back to two simple questions: (a) Which are the events that need tracking? (b) How does the mechanism translate back to a simple causal history? Without a simple mental image to guide us, errors and misconceptions become much more common. Sometimes, one only needs the right language. Acknowledgments [| would like to thank Nuno Preguica and Paulo Sergio Almeida for their feedback on this work.", "tokens": 610, "label": "heavy"}
